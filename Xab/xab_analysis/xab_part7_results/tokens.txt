introduction
out-of-vocabulary
oov
words
constitute
a
major
problem
in
cross-language
information
retrieval
clir
and
machine
translation
mt
in
those
cases
where
equivalent
terms
in
different
languages
are
etymologically
related
technical
terms
cross-lingual
spelling
variants--as
german
konstruktion
and
english
construction
it
is
possible
to
use
a
transliteration
type
of
translation
to
recognize
the
target
language
equivalents
of
the
source
language
words
in
pirkola
et
al
2003
we
generated
automatically
large
collections
of
character
correspondences
in
several
language
pairs
for
the
translation
of
cross-lingual
spelling
variants
equivalent
term
pairs
in
two
languages
were
first
extracted
automatically
from
translation
dictionaries
and
then
regular
character
correspondences
between
the
words
in
the
two
languages
were
identified
using
an
edit
distance
measure
large
sets
of
transformation
rules
augmented
with
statistical
information
were
generated
for
automatic
translation
of
spelling
variants
we
call
the
translation
technique
based
on
the
generated
rules
transformation
rule
based
translation
trt
trt
is
similar
to
transliteration
except
that
no
phonetic
elements
are
involved
in
it
the
term
fuzzy
translation
is
used
in
connection
with
trt
it
refers
to
the
fact
that
trt
often
gives
many
possible
equivalents
for
a
source
word
not
one
equivalent
or
several
alternatives
like
regular
translation
in
toivonen
et
al
2005
we
showed
that
high
translation
recall--the
proportion
of
source
words
for
which
trt
yields
equivalents
among
all
source
words--may
be
achieved
when
most
of
the
rules
available
for
a
source
word
are
used
in
trt
however
high
translation
recall
is
associated
with
low
translation
precision
the
proportion
of
equivalents
among
all
word
forms
yielded
by
trt
in
other
words
the
translation
set
containing
the
target
language
word
forms
often
includes
the
correct
translation
equivalent
of
a
source
word
and
a
large
number
of
other
word
forms
it
is
obvious
that
a
technique
where
words
not
found
in
a
dictionary
are
translated
by
transformation
rules
would
be
useful
in
many
information
systems
where
automatic
translation
is
part
of
the
system
however
in
many
cases
the
trt
technique
may
be
useless
if
it
just
indicates
a
set
of
possible
translations
for
a
source
word
but
is
not
able
to
indicate
the
one
correct
equivalent
which
was
the
case
in
pirkola
et
al
2003
as
well
as
in
toivonen
et
al
2005
in
the
present
research
we
attack
this
problem
moving
trt
from
fuzzy
translation
towards
dictionary-like
translation
where
for
each
source
word
either
one
translation
equivalent
is
indicated
or
the
source
word
is
indicated
not
to
be
translatable
by
means
of
trt
for
this
we
developed
a
novel
statistical
equivalent
identification
technique
called
frequency-based
identification
of
translation
equivalents
fite
the
identification
of
equivalents
is
based
on
regular
frequency
patterns
associated
with
the
target
word
forms
obtained
by
trt
in
this
paper
we
also
present
a
novel
feature
of
trt
translation
through
indirect
translation
routes
if
a
direct
translation
from
a
source
language
into
a
target
language
fails
to
find
an
equivalent
the
source
word
is
retranslated
into
a
target
language
through
intermediate
pivot
languages
as
in
the
case
of
direct
translation
the
equivalents
are
identified
from
trt
s
translation
set
by
means
of
the
novel
fite
technique
transitive
translation
through
a
pivot
language
is
a
well-known
technique
in
clir
used
to
address
the
problem
of
limited
availability
of

resources
ballesteros

indirect
translation
could
be
used
in
trt
in
cases
where
direct
translation
is
not
possible
due
to
the
lack
of
translation
resources
transformation
rules
in
this
study
however
we
investigate
whether
indirect
translation
improves
fite-trt
effectiveness
it
may
compensate
the
failures
of
direct
translation
and
thereby
increase
translation
recall
we
explore
the
effectiveness
of
fite
in
spanish-english
and
finnishenglish
trt
german

french

as

for
both

fite-trt

in
this

we
describe
the

more
detail
present
the
find-equivalent

and
extend
the
first
study
by
using
large
word
frequency
lists
mined
from

as
fite-trt
s
frequency
source
and
by
comparing
fite-trt
to
other
oov

methods
in

experiments
the
novel
fite-trt
technique
is
fundamentally
different
from
other
oov
word
methods/systems
presented
in
the
literature
for
instance
cheng
et
al
2004
and
zhang
and
vines
2004
both
developed
a
web-based
translation
method
for
chinese-english
oov
words
where
the
oov
words
were
extracted
from
bilingual
chinese-english
texts
found
in
chinese
web
pages
using
word
co-occurrence
statistics
and
syntactic
structures
meng
et

2000
employed
a
trt
type
rule-based
approach
to
the
oov
word
problem
phonetic
mappings
were
derived
from
english
and
chinese
mandarin
pronunciation
rules
for

retrieval
the
researchers
also
considered
chinese
name
variation
an
english
proper
name
may
have
several
character
sequence
variants
and
pronunciations
in
chinese
to
combat
this
problem
the
transliteration
approach
should
involve
approximate
matches
between
the
english
and
chinese
pronunciations
fujii
and
ishikawa
2001
used
characterbased
rules
to
establish
mapping
between
english
characters
and
romanized
japanese
katakana
characters
they
also
utilized
probabilistic
character-based
language
models
which
can
be
seen
as
a
variation
of
fuzzy
matching
the
technique
is
different
from
fite-trt
but
bears
some
resemblance
to
the
fuzzy
translation
reported
in
pirkola

2003
however
focusing
on
languages
with
different
orthographies
thus
having
a
different

research
the
idea
of
trt
and
the
automatic
method
to
generate
transformation
rules
is
described
in
pirkola
et
al
2003
a
transformation
rule
contains
source
and
target
language
characters
that
are
transformed
and
their
context
characters
in
addition
there
are
two
important
numerical
factors
associated
with
a
rule
frequency
and
confidence
factor
which
may
be
used
as
thresholds
to
select
the
most
common
and
reliable
rules
for
trt
frequency
refers
to
the
number
of
the
occurrences
of
the
rule
in
the
dictionary
data
that
was
used
for
the
rule
generation
confidence
factor
cf
is
defined
as
the
frequency
of
a
rule
divided
by
the
number
of
source
words
where
the

3
in

et

2003
we
studied
trt
in
combination
with
fuzzy
matching--
digram
and
trigram
matching
we
investigated
five
source
languages
with
english
being
a
target
language
for
all
the
source
languages
the
results
showed
that
for
finnish
german
and
spanish
the
combined
technique
performed
better
than
digrams
and
trigrams
alone
for
french
and
swedish
performance
changes
were
slight
in
toivonen
et
al
2005
we
studied
how
effective
trt
is
without
fuzzy
matching
we
found
that
translation
recall
was
high
when
low
frequency
and
confidence
factor
were
used
as
thresholds
to
select
the
rules
for
trt
however
at
low
confidence
factor
and
frequency
levels
translation
precision
was
low
the
fite-trt
technique
addresses
this
problem
and
as
we
will
show
in
this
article
it
achieves
both
high
recall
and
precision
the
transformation
rules
used
in
trt
in
this
study
were
generated
using
the
rule
generation
method
based
on
the
use
of
dictionary
data
described
in
pirkola
et
al
2003
the
dictionary
data
consisted
of
a
multilingual
medical
dictionary
by
andre
fairchild
http
//members
interfold
com/translator/
for
the
language
pairs
of
spanish-english
spanish-german
spanish-french
german-english
and
french-english
for
finnish-english
the
data
for
rule
generation
was
obtained
by
translating
1
a
list
of
finnish
medical
terms
into
english
using
a
medical
dictionary
by
kielikone
inc
and
2
a
list
of
finnish
terms
in
various
domains
into
english
using
kielikone
s
general-purpose
dictionary
thus
for
finnish-english
we
constructed
two
collections
the
second
collection
was
constructed
because
the
first
collection
missed
many
important
rules
table
i
shows
the
number
of
entries
and
the
average
number
of
translations
per
an
entry
for
each

used
in
the
rule

columns
2
and

table
i
also
shows
the
total
number
of
rules
in
the

as

the

and

2
applied
in
this
study
columns
4
and
5
we
applied
the
confidence
factor
and
frequency
thresholds
because
trt
may
give
very
large
translation
sets
and
at
the
present
stage
of
development
the
trt
program
is
not
efficient
enough
to
process
very
large
word
sets
due
to
the
efficiency
issues
we
also
applied
a
limit
of
40
word
forms
if
there
were
more
than
40
word
forms
in
a
translation
set
of
an
intermediate
language
the
source
word
was
retranslated
by
trt
with
a
confidence
factor
of
10
0
and
frequency
of
10
to
yield
a
smaller
translation
set
as
can
be
seen
in
table
i
each
rule
collection
contains
a
high
number
of
rules
which
suggests
that
the
rule
generation
method
effectively
captured
spelling
variation
between
the
language
pairs
3
research
problems
and
evaluation
measures
we
distinguish
between
two
kinds
of
words
in
a
language
with
respect
to
the
words
in
another
language
cross-lingual
spelling
variants
and
native
words
cross-lingual
spelling
variants
are
etymologically
related
words
and
therefore
similar
in
the
two
languages
differing
only
slightly
in
spelling
a
native
word
and
its
target
language
equivalent
are
not
related
to
each
other
morphologically
even
if
they
share
the
same
meaning
the
words
have
different
origins
and
etymologies
in
the
history
of
the
respective
languages
the
words
do
not
have
morphological
or
phonetic
resemblance--or
if
there
is
some
it
is
purely
accidental
as
examples
consider
the
english
words
computer
and
chemotherapy
and
their
finnish
equivalents
tietokone
and
kemoterapia
the
first
pair
computertietokone
do
not
have
morphological
or
phonetic
resemblance
computer
originating
from
latin
computare
to
calculate
and
tietokone
being
a
compound
of
knowledge
and
machine
the
finnish
words
tieto
and
kone
are
old
words
in
the
language
in
the
second
pair
chemotherapy-kemoterapia
both
words
originate
from
greek
chemeia
therapeia
and
albeit
having
been
modified
to
fit
the
style
of
their
present
languages
still
have
not
lost
their
morphological
or
phonetic
resemblance
trt
is
intended
to
translate
spelling
variants
and
fite
is
intended
to
identify
the
translation
equivalents
of
spelling
variants
and
to
indicate
the
native
source
language
words--the
source
words
that
cannot
be
correctly
translated
by
trt
using
test
word
sets
containing
both
types
of
words
we
examine
the
following
research
questions
r
in
the
case
of

how
to
effectively
identify
the
correct
equivalent
of
a

word
among
the
many
word
forms
produced
by
trt

most
of
the
transformation

available
for
a

are
used
in

r
what
are
the
translation

see
the

of

r
what
is
the
contribution
of
each
step
in
the
fite-trt
process
to
its
overall
effectiveness
r
what
is
the
effectiveness
of
a
standard
clir
system
boosted
by
the
use
of
fite-trt
in
comparison
to
a
clir
system
augmented
with
trt
and
fuzzy
matching
oov
word
methods
and
in
comparison
to
dictionary-translationonly
clir
and
monolingual
baselines
the
effectiveness
of
fite-trt
was
evaluated
by
using
the
measures
of
translation
recall
translation
precision
and
indication
precision
for
spelling
variants
translation
recall
is
defined
as
the
proportion
of
source
words
for
which
fite
identifies
correct
equivalents
among
all
source
words
for
example
if
there
are
10
source
words
and
trt
gives
for
these
100
target
language
word
forms
among
which
there
are
correct
equivalents
for
8
source
words
then
translation
recall
is
8/10
80
translation
precision
is
defined
as
the
proportion
of
correct
equivalents
among
all
words
that
are
indicated
as
equivalents
for
example
if
fite
identifies
10
translation
equivalents
of
which
9
are
correct
equivalents
translation
precision
is
9/10
90
for
native
words
the
question
of
what
share
of
them
is
translated
by
trt
is
an
irrelevant
question
and
naturally
recall
is
not
measured
for
them
for
native
source
words
indication
precision
is
defined
as
the
proportion
of
words
correctly
indicated
to
be
untranslatable
by
trt
for
example
if
there
are
5
native
source
words
and
fite
indicates
that
none
of
these
translation
equivalents
are
contained
in
the
translation
sets
indication
precision
is

a

which
reported
for

the

the

were
mined
from
the

using
a
web
mining
technique
which
is
described
next
in
the
first
step
of
the
web
mining
process
a
query
script
based
on
the
use
of
text-based
web
browser
lynx
was
run
to
fetch
medical
and
biological
documents
in
a
desired
language
from
the
google
search
engine
the
query
script
described
in
zhang
and
vines
2004
was
modified
for
this
purpose
we
used
the
following
parameters
and

conjuncted
by
the
and-operator
and
the
corresponding

in
finnish
german
and
spanish
the
use
of
these
keys
directed
the
actual
web
mining
towards
medical
and
biological
sub-webs
in
the
second
step
urls
were
extracted
from
the
fetched
documents
and
were
saved
in
a
file
in
the
third
step
the
url
file
was
cleaned
by
removing
duplicates
so
that
only
urls
with
unique
domain
names
were
kept
in
the
file
the
url
file
served
as
an
input
for
the
fourth
step
the
actual

mining
stage
where
documents
were
downloaded
from
each

site
represented
in
the

using
a

were
downloaded
in
the
fifth
step
of
the
process
all
downloaded
documents
were
combined
into
one
large
file
in
the
sixth
step
word
frequency
lists
were
constructed
from
the
combined
document
file
the
number
of
documents
downloaded
from
the

varied
depending
on
the

its
minor
contribution
was
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
it

than
due
to

the
core
of
fite
is
that
except
for
the
translation
equivalents
the
word
forms
yielded
by
trt
are
malformed
rather
than
real
words
or
they
are
rare
words
for
example
foreign

words
in
the

the

belong
to
a
language
s
basic
lexicon
and
are
much
more
common
in
the
language
than
the

forms
this
regular
frequency
pattern
allows
the
identification
of

the

obtained
by

for

the

we

that
the

holds
for

the
main
criteria
of

are
the

the

of

tested
by

the
relative

criterion
tested
by
the
rel-df/rel-wf
functions
and

length
criterion
tested
by
the

the
basic
idea
is
to
apply
the
criteria

in
three
steps
a
c

in
step
a
direct
translation
is
tried
and
then
in
steps
b

the
pivot
language
translations
one

the
other
the
criteria
are
first
applied
to
the
highest
ranking
target
word
candidate
as
given
by
the
function
trt-frank
if
these
steps
do
not
yield
a
solution
then
basically
the
same
steps
are
repeated
with
the
second
highest
ranking
target
word
candidate
this
process
is
specified
as
algorithm
find-equivalent
which
is
presented
in
the
appendix
the
algorithm
is
for
the
case
of

lists
s
and

for
the

in

the

are
replaced
by
a

that
gives
the

the

bases
for
the

in

we
use
the
notations
and
functions
of
preceding
sections
in
the
definition
of
the

the
algorithm
find-equivalent
first
tries
the
first

produced

direct

processes
it
calls
the
procedure
direct-trans
to
produce
the
frequency-based
ranking
of
the
direct
trt
candidates
the
procedure
generates
them
as
the
list
r
and
then
the
first

of

is

differed
from

in

thanks
to

the

all
the

were

thus
equivalents
in

and
the

were
not

then
we

we
used
a

in
addition
to
native

the

contain
spanish-english

the
effectiveness
of
fite-trt
was
evaluated
using
four
sets
of
test
words
for
each

language
word
set
there
was
a
corresponding
english
word
set
that
contained
the

of
the

words
for
the

of
english
biological

was
gathered
manually
from

the
english

were
translated
into
spanish

by

dictionaries
and
monolingual
spanish

finnish
medical
dictionaries
from
these
words
we
selected
spanish-english

for
our

the

was
done
based
on
the

judged
by

the

used
as

is
discussed
in

later
in

the
difference
in

reflects
the
different

see

indirect
fuzzy

also
indirect
trt

fite-trt
s
high

it

perform
better
than

fite-trt

which
were

the

and

resulted

the

performance
of

however
it

discussion
and
conclusions
in
this
study
we
first
examined
the
following
two
basic
questions
regarding
spelling
variants
how
to
effectively
identify
the
correct
equivalent
of
a
source
word
among
the
many
word
forms
produced
by
trt
when
most
of
the
transformation
rules
available
for
a
language
pair
are
used
in
trt
how
to
reliably
identify
native
source
language
words
source
words
that
cannot
be
correctly
translated
by
trt
we
devised
the
fite-trt
technique--a
novel
oov
word
translation
technique
its
effectiveness
was
tested
for
spanish-english
and
finnish-english
spelling
variants
and
actual
oov
words
in
the
domains
of
biology
and
medicine
here
the
research
questions
were
as
follows
what
are
the
translation
recall
and
precision
and
indication
precision
of
the
proposed
fite-trt
method
are
word
frequency
lists
mined
from
the
web
competitive
with
the
web
as
a
collection
of
documents
as
fite-trt
s
frequency
source
what
is
the
contribution
of
each
step
direct
and
indirect
translation
routes
in
the
fite-trt
process
to
its
overall
effectiveness
we
found
that
depending
on
the
source
language
and
frequency
source
fitetrt
may
achieve
high
translation
recall
when
equivalents
were
identified
on
the
basis
of
web
document
frequencies
spanish-english
fite-trt
achieved
89

91
0
recall
for
finnish-english
and
for
frequency
lists
mined
from
the
web
recall
was
lower
but
still
substantial
the
lowest
recall
67
4
was
obtained
for
finnish-english/frequency
lists
the
results
indicated
that
fitetrt
achieves
high
precision
fite
indicates
precisely
the
equivalents
of
source
words
as
well
as
the
native
words
for
spanish-english
and
finnish-english
test
words
translation
precision
was
95
0
98
8
all
native
oov
words
were
correctly
indicated
to
be
untranslatable
by
trt
the
test
requests
only
contained
10
native
oov
words
the
results
reported
here
need
to
be
corroborated
using
a
larger
set
of
native
words
the
contribution
of
direct
translation
to
the
overall
recall
was
substantial
for
spanish-english
bio-terms
direct
translation
achieved
82
0
recall
while
the
overall
recall
was
91
0
we
expected
that
finnish-english
fite-trt
through
pivot
languages
would
have
compensated
failures
of
direct
translation
but
that
did
not
happen
indirect
translation
did
not
help
at
all
these
findings
suggest
that
that
the
costs
of
indirect
translation
against
its
benefits
are
high
because
a
pivot
language
increases
fite-trt
complexity
it
does
not
seem
sensible
to
use
two
pivot
languages
as
part
of
a
fite-trt
system
last
we
examined
the
effectiveness
of
a
standard
clir
system
boosted
by
the
use
of
fite-trt
in
comparison
to
a
clir
system
augmented
with
trt
and
fuzzy
matching
oov
word
methods
and
in
comparison
to
dictionarytranslation-only
clir
and
monolingual
baselines
it
was
shown
that
fitetrt
with
web
document
frequencies
was
the
best
technique
among
several
approaches
to
handling
oov
words
tested
in
the
experiments
dictionarybased
clir
augmented
with
fite-trt
performed
substantially
better
than
the
baseline
where
oov
keys
were
kept
intact
in
spanish-english
clir
map
improvement
percentages
were
40
3
web
and
35

frequency

also
finnish-english
fite-trt
queries
remarkably
outperformed
the
clir
baseline
although
performance
improvements
were
smaller
than
in
the
case
of
spanish-english
about
26
for
both
web
and
frequency
lists
the
trt
program
we
used
in
this
study
was
not
able
to
process
a
high
number
of
word
forms
in
a
reasonable
time
frame
and
we
had
to
apply
cf
and
frequency
thresholds
in
the
preliminary
tests
we
translated
without
using
any
thresholds
and
for
long
words
we
had
to
end
the
program
because
it
was
not
able
to
complete
the
translation
process
within
a
day
we
observed
that
for
many
source
words
equivalents
were
not
found
in
translation
sets
because
the
cfs
and/or
frequencies
of
the
relevant
rules
were
below
the
thresholds
we
therefore
expect
that
recall
values
can
still
be
improved
by
using
a
more
sophisticated
trt
program
that
allows
efficient
trt
even
without
the
use
of
thresholds
for
example
in
the
case
of
spanish/bio-terms/web
there
were
81
correct
identifications
one
wrong
identification
and
seven
words
for
which
trt
did
not
identify
equivalents
for
five
of
the
seven
words
equivalents
were
not
contained
in
the
translation
sets
because
of
low
cf
or
frequency
rules
the
five
words
and
the
rules
are
shown
in
table
xii
also
deficiencies
in
the
finnish-english
rule
collections
and
word
frequency
lists
caused
recall
errors
fite-trt
effectiveness
was
better
for
spanishenglish
than
finnish-english
the
better
effectiveness
can
be
attributed
to
the
higher
quality
of
spanish-english
rule
collection
deficiencies
in
the
finnishenglish
transformation
rules
can
be
overcome
by
using
more
data
in
rule
generation
the
frequency
lists
we
constructed
using
web
mining
turned
out
to
be
good
frequency
data
for
fite
however
for
some
source
word/equivalent
pairs
frequencies
were
too
low
for
rel-wf
formula
which
resulted
in
a
decrease
in
recall
performance
this
deficiency
can
be
overcome
by
adding
more
data
to
the
existing
lists
the
main
advantage
of
using
frequency
lists
is
that
after
the
lists
have
been
constructed
fite-trt
is
independent
of
the
web
this
is
important
when
a
practical
fite-trt
implementation
is
developed
the
frequency
lists
we
used
contain
biological
and
medical
terms
in
accordance
with
the
test
terminology
used
in
the
study
the
lists
are
large
and
contain
terms
in
various
domains
the
application
of
fite-trt
in
the
other
domains
may
require
lists
with
different
types
of
terms
however
for
each
domain
the
lists
are
concise
enough
to
be
held
in
main
memory
for
efficient
implementation
overall
the
percentage
of
wrong
equivalents
indicated
by
fite
was
small
the
identification
of
derivatives
and
plural
forms
of
the
correct
equivalents
was
the
primary
cause
of
precision
errors
as
an
example
for
the
finnish
word
leukosyytti
and
the
spanish
word
bacteria
the
correct
equivalents
are
leucocyte
and
bacterium
while
fite
gave
the
words
leucocytic
and
bacteria
many
of
these
types
of
cases
could
be
solved
by
augmenting
the
transformation
rules
with
word
class
information
for
example
that
a
rule
is
likely
to
refer
an
adjective
rather
than
a
noun
information
on
oov
word
s
word
class
is
achieved
when
the
sentential
context
of
the
oov
word
is
known
at
present
trt
is
only
intended
to
translate
singular
base
forms
word
class
information
is
needed
if
fite-trt
will
be
applied
to
running
texts
containing
inflectional
word
forms
this
would
imply
the
supplementation
of
rule
collections
with
word
class
information
the
next
main
challenge
in
the
fite-trt
research
is
to
improve
the
rules
such
that
fite-trt
can
handle
words
in
a
running
text
the
clir
experiments
showed
that
the
best
fuzzy
translation/matchingbased
query
was
fite-trt
with
web
document
frequencies
the
fite
component
of
fite-trt
was
the
focus
of
this
article
and
here
an
important
issue
is
its
contribution
in
clir
the
results
showed
that
in
the
case
of
finnish-english
fite-trt
was
significantly
better
than
plain
trt
but
only
at
p
0
05
in
the
case
of
spanish-english
fite-trt
did
not
show
significantly
better
results
overall
the
results
are
inconclusive
and
the
issue
needs
to
be
investigated
more
thoroughly
in
future
research
such
factors
as
query
structure
and
other
than
oov
keys
affect
the
effectiveness
of
fite-trt
and
trt
queries
also
efficiency
needs
to
be
taken
into
account
in
future
research
trt
queries
are
much
longer
than
fite-trt
queries
and
thus
require
more
processing
power
on
the
other
hand
the
fite
component
of
fite-trt
increases
computational
expense
in
other
information
systems
than
retrieval
systems
in
particular
in
mt
fuzzy
translation
trt
does
not
come
into
question
the
good
quality
of
translations
achieved
through
fite-trt
suggests
that
it
can
contribute
to
better
mt
performance
there
is
still
one
clir-related
application
of
fite-trt
that
is
worth
mentioning
an
automatic
construction
of
multilingual
dictionaries
of
technical
terms
and
proper
names
by
means
of
fite-trt
the
dictionary
construction
process
could
be
designed
to
be
largely
automatic
thanks
to
fite-trt
s
high
degree
of
effectiveness
given
a
list
of
words
and
a
set
of
transformation
rule
collections
the
process
would
automatically
yield
the
translation
equivalents
of
the
words
in
different
languages--the
result
would
essentially
be
a
multilingual
dictionary
the
construction
of
dictionaries
is
a
non-time-critical
task
given
enough
time
it
would
be
possible
to
construct
large
multilingual
dictionaries
the
cost
benefits
of
an
automatic
method
are
obvious
it
can
easily
be
seen
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
cost
of
automatic
as
opposed
to
manual
construction
of
a
dictionary
of
say
10
languages
and
50
000
dictionary
entries
