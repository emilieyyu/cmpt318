Frequency Based Identification of Correct Translation Equivalents FITE Obtained Through Transformation Rules ARI PIRKOLA JARMO TOIVONEN HEIKKI KESKUSTALO and KALERVO JARVELIN University of Tampere We devised a novel statistical technique for the identification of the translation equivalents of source words obtained by transformation rule based translation TRT 
 The effectiveness of the technique called frequency based identification of translation equivalents FITE was tested using biological and medical cross lingual spelling variants and out of vocabulary OOV words in Spanish English and Finnish English TRT
 The results showed that depending on the source language and frequency corpus FITE TRT the identification of translation equivalents from TRT s translation set by means of the FITE technique may achieve high translation recall
 In the case of the Web as the frequency corpus translation recall was 89
2 91
0 for Spanish English FITE TRT
 For both language pairs FITE TRT achieved high translation precision 95
0 98
8 
 The technique also reliably identified native source language words source words that cannot be correctly translated by TRT
 Dictionary based CLIR augmented with FITE TRT performed substantially better than basic dictionary based CLIR where OOV keys were kept intact
 FITE TRT with Web document frequencies was the best technique among several fuzzy translation
matching approaches tested in cross language retrieval experiments
 We also discuss the application of FITE TRT in the automatic construction of multilingual dictionaries

 INTRODUCTION Out of vocabulary OOV words constitute a major problem in cross language information retrieval CLIR and machine translation MT 
 In those cases where equivalent terms in different languages are etymologically related technical terms cross lingual spelling variants as German konstruktion and English construction it is possible to use a transliteration type of translation to recognize the target language equivalents of the source language words
 In Pirkola et al
 2003 we generated automatically large collections of character correspondences in several language pairs for the translation of cross lingual spelling variants
 Equivalent term pairs in two languages were first extracted automatically from translation dictionaries and then regular character correspondences between the words in the two languages were identified using an edit distance measure
 Large sets of transformation rules augmented with statistical information were generated for automatic translation of spelling variants
 We call the translation technique based on the generated rules transformation rule based translation TRT 
 TRT is similar to transliteration except that no phonetic elements are involved in it
 The term fuzzy translation is used in connection with TRT
 It refers to the fact that TRT often gives many possible equivalents for a source word not one equivalent or several alternatives like regular translation
 In Toivonen et al
 2005 we showed that high translation recall the proportion of source words for which TRT yields equivalents among all source words may be achieved when most of the rules available for a source word are used in TRT
 However high translation recall is associated with low translation precision the proportion of equivalents among all word forms yielded by TRT 
 In other words the translation set containing the target language word forms often includes the correct translation equivalent of a source word and a large number of other word forms
 It is obvious that a technique where words not found in a dictionary are translated by transformation rules would be useful in many information systems where automatic translation is part of the system
 However in many cases the TRT technique may be useless if it just indicates a set of possible translations for a source word but is not able to indicate the one correct equivalent which was the case in Pirkola et al
 2003 as well as in Toivonen et al
 2005 
 In the present research we attack this problem moving TRT from fuzzy translation towards dictionary like translation where for each source word either one translation equivalent is indicated or the source word is indicated not to be translatable by means of TRT
 For this we developed a novel statistical equivalent identification technique called frequency based identification of translation equivalents FITE 
 The identification of equivalents is based on regular frequency patterns associated with the target word forms obtained by TRT
 In this paper we also present a novel feature of TRT translation through indirect translation routes
 If a direct translation from a source language into a target language fails to find an equivalent the source word is retranslated into a target language through intermediate pivot languages
 As in the case of direct translation the equivalents are identified from TRT s translation set by means of the novel FITE technique
 Transitive translation through a pivot language is a well known technique in CLIR used to address the problem of limited availability of translation resources Ballesteros 2000 Gollins and Sanderson 2001 Lehtokangas et al
 2004 
 Indirect translation could be used in TRT in cases where direct translation is not possible due to the lack of translation resources transformation rules 
 In this study however we investigate whether indirect translation improves FITE TRT effectiveness
 It may compensate the failures of direct translation and thereby increase translation recall
 We explore the effectiveness of FITE in Spanish English and FinnishEnglish TRT
 German and French serve as intermediate languages for both language pairs
 As test words we use terms in the domains of biology and medicine
 The terms were selected from texts and real information requests of biomedical researchers
 FITE TRT is also applied as part of an actual CLIR system
 The effectiveness of dictionary based CLIR augmented with FITE TRT is compared to the effectiveness of dictionary based CLIR augmented with plain TRT and skipgram Keskustalo et al
 2003 OOV word methods
 We also run dictionary translationonly no OOV word technique is applied and monolingual English queries as baselines
 In Pirkola et al
 2006 we presented the main features of FITE TRT and the first results on FITE TRT effectiveness and the effectiveness of CLIR augmented with FITE TRT
 In this article we describe the FITE TRT technique in more detail present the find equivalent algorithm and extend the first study by using large word frequency lists mined from the Web as FITE TRT s frequency source and by comparing FITE TRT to other OOV word methods in cross language retrieval experiments
 The novel FITE TRT technique is fundamentally different from other OOV word methods
systems presented in the literature
 For instance Cheng et al
 2004 and Zhang and Vines 2004 both developed a Web based translation method for Chinese English OOV words where the OOV words were extracted from bilingual Chinese English texts found in Chinese Web pages using word co occurrence statistics and syntactic structures
 Meng et al
 2000 employed a TRT type rule based approach to the OOV word problem
 Phonetic mappings were derived from English and Chinese Mandarin pronunciation rules for English Chinese spoken document retrieval
 The researchers also considered Chinese name variation
 An English proper name may have several character sequence variants and pronunciations in Chinese
 To combat this problem the transliteration approach should involve approximate matches between the English and Chinese pronunciations
 Fujii and Ishikawa 2001 used characterbased rules to establish mapping between English characters and romanized Japanese katakana characters
 They also utilized probabilistic character based language models which can be seen as a variation of fuzzy matching
 The technique is different from FITE TRT but bears some resemblance to the fuzzy translation reported in Pirkola et al
 2003 however focusing on languages with different orthographies thus having a different focus
 The skipgram fuzzy matching approach to OOV words by Keskustalo et al
 2003 is discussed in Section 5

 TRT TRANSFORMATION RULES AND BACKGROUND RESEARCH The idea of TRT and the automatic method to generate transformation rules is described in Pirkola et al
 2003 
 A transformation rule contains source and target language characters that are transformed and their context characters
 In addition there are two important numerical factors associated with a rule frequency and confidence factor which may be used as thresholds to select the most common and reliable rules for TRT
 Frequency refers to the number of the occurrences of the rule in the dictionary data that was used for the rule generation
 Confidence factor CF is defined as the frequency of a rule divided by the number of source words where the source substring of the rule occurs
 Below we present an example of a German English rule ekt ect middle 191 214 89
25 The rule is read as follows the letter k prior to t and after e is transformed into the letter c in the middle of words with the confidence factor being 89
25 100 191
214 
 Examples of target word forms obtained in TRT are shown in Sections 4
2 and 4

 In Pirkola et al
 2003 we studied TRT in combination with fuzzy matching digram and trigram matching
 We investigated five source languages with English being a target language for all the source languages
 The results showed that for Finnish German and Spanish the combined technique performed better than digrams and trigrams alone
 For French and Swedish performance changes were slight
 In Toivonen et al
 2005 we studied how effective TRT is without fuzzy matching
 We found that translation recall was high when low frequency and confidence factor were used as thresholds to select the rules for TRT
 However at low confidence factor and frequency levels translation precision was low
 The FITE TRT technique addresses this problem and as we will show in this article it achieves both high recall and precision
 The transformation rules used in TRT in this study were generated using the rule generation method based on the use of dictionary data described in Pirkola et al
 2003 
 The dictionary data consisted of a multilingual medical dictionary by Andre Fairchild http 

members
interfold
com
translator
 for the language pairs of Spanish English Spanish German Spanish French German English and French English
 For Finnish English the data for rule generation was obtained by translating 1 a list of Finnish medical terms into English using a medical dictionary by Kielikone Inc
 and 2 a list of Finnish terms in various domains into English using Kielikone s general purpose dictionary
 Thus for Finnish English we constructed two collections
 The second collection was constructed because the first collection missed many important rules
 Table I shows the number of entries and the average number of translations per an entry for each dictionary used in the rule generation columns 2 and 3 
 Table I also shows the total number of rules in the generated rule collections as well the number of rules at or above the thresholds of CF 4
0 and frequency 2 applied in this study columns 4 and 5 
 We applied the confidence factor and frequency thresholds because TRT may give very large translation sets and at the present stage of development the TRT program is not efficient enough to process very large word sets
 Due to the efficiency issues we also applied a limit of 40 word forms if there were more than 40 word forms in a translation set of an intermediate language the source word was retranslated by TRT with a confidence factor of 10
0 and frequency of 10 to yield a smaller translation set
 As can be seen in Table I each rule collection contains a high number of rules which suggests that the rule generation method effectively captured spelling variation between the language pairs

 RESEARCH PROBLEMS AND EVALUATION MEASURES We distinguish between two kinds of words in a language with respect to the words in another language cross lingual spelling variants and native words
 Cross lingual spelling variants are etymologically related words and therefore similar in the two languages differing only slightly in spelling
 A native word and its target language equivalent are not related to each other morphologically even if they share the same meaning
 The words have different origins and etymologies in the history of the respective languages
 The words do not have morphological or phonetic resemblance or if there is some it is purely accidental
 As examples consider the English words computer and chemotherapy and their Finnish equivalents tietokone and kemoterapia
 The first pair computertietokone do not have morphological or phonetic resemblance computer originating from Latin computare to calculate and tietokone being a compound of knowledge and machine
 The Finnish words tieto and kone are old words in the language
 In the second pair chemotherapy kemoterapia both words originate from Greek chemeia therapeia and albeit having been modified to fit the style of their present languages still have not lost their morphological or phonetic resemblance
 TRT is intended to translate spelling variants and FITE is intended to identify the translation equivalents of spelling variants and to indicate the native source language words the source words that cannot be correctly translated by TRT
 Using test word sets containing both types of words we examine the following research questions r In the case of spelling variants how to effectively identify the correct equivalent of a source word among the many word forms produced by TRT when most of the transformation rules available for a language pair are used in TRT
 r How to reliably identify native source language words
 r Are word frequency lists mined from the Web competitive with the Web as a collection of documents as FITE TRT s frequency source
 r What are the translation recall and precision and indication precision see the definitions below of the proposed FITE TRT method
 r What is the contribution of each step in the FITE TRT process to its overall effectiveness
 r What is the effectiveness of a standard CLIR system boosted by the use of FITE TRT in comparison to a CLIR system augmented with TRT and fuzzy matching OOV word methods and in comparison to dictionary translationonly CLIR and monolingual baselines
 The effectiveness of FITE TRT was evaluated by using the measures of translation recall translation precision and indication precision
 For spelling variants translation recall is defined as the proportion of source words for which FITE identifies correct equivalents among all source words
 For example if there are 10 source words and TRT gives for these 100 target language word forms among which there are correct equivalents for 8 source words then translation recall is 8
10 80 
 Translation precision is defined as the proportion of correct equivalents among all words that are indicated as equivalents
 For example if FITE identifies 10 translation equivalents of which 9 are correct equivalents translation precision is 9
10 90 
 For native words the question of what share of them is translated by TRT is an irrelevant question and naturally recall is not measured for them
 For native source words indication precision is defined as the proportion of words correctly indicated to be untranslatable by TRT
 For example if there are 5 native source words and FITE indicates that none of these translation equivalents are contained in the translation sets indication precision is 5
5 100 
 Retrieval effectiveness was evaluated using the measures of mean average precision MAP and precision at 20 documents
 MAP is a standard evaluation measure used in TREC http 

trec
nist
gov and it refers to the average of the precision values obtained after each relevant document is retrieved
 MAP is a system oriented measure while precision at 20 documents is important from the practical IR standpoint
 The probability of a searcher scanning further down a ranked result list decreases as s he scans down and we use a document cutoff value of 20 as a rule of thumb for the stopping point of scan

 THE FITE TECHNIQUE 4
1 Frequency Data FITE identifies the correct translation equivalents among the TRT generated word forms by their frequency distribution in some corpus
 Frequencies for FITE were taken from the Web and word frequency lists
 In the case of the Web we consider document frequency DF and in the case of frequency lists word frequency WF 
 DF statistics were collected using the Altavista search engine and its language selection feature
 A research assistant fed the word forms into the search engine which reported for each word form the number of documents containing the word form
 The word frequency lists were mined from the Web using a Web mining technique which is described next
 In the first step of the Web mining process a query script based on the use of text based Web browser Lynx was run to fetch medical and biological documents in a desired language from the Google search engine
 The query script described in Zhang and Vines 2004 was modified for this purpose
 We used the following parameters and parameter values in the script language English
Finnish
German
Spanish the number of documents to fetch 700 query keys the words medicine biology and disease conjuncted by the AND operator and the corresponding words in Finnish German and Spanish 
 The use of these keys directed the actual Web mining towards medical and biological sub Webs
 In the second step URLs were extracted from the fetched documents and were saved in a file
 In the third step the URL file was cleaned by removing duplicates so that only URLs with unique domain names were kept in the file
 The URL file served as an input for the fourth step the actual Web mining stage where documents were downloaded from each Web site represented in the URL file using a wget program http 

www
gnu
org
software
wget
 
 Wget s parameter directory depth was set at 3 on each Web site documents at directory depths 1 3 were downloaded
 In the fifth step of the process all downloaded documents were combined into one large file
 In the sixth step word frequency lists were constructed from the combined document file
 The number of documents downloaded from the Web varied depending on the language
 For example for German 35 000 documents were downloaded
 The total size of these documents was 2
26 GB
 The numbers of unique words contained in the frequency lists are as follows English 762 000 words Finnish 886 000 words German 470 000 words Spanish 386 000 words intermediate language French was small it was not considered in the frequency list experiments and we did not construct a word frequency list for French
 Its minor contribution was probably due to the fact that it was used as the second intermediate language rather than due to its linguistic features
 In statistical MT the choice between translation alternatives depends on the translation probabilities of the alternatives and their context Al Onaizan et al
 1999 Brown et al
 1990 
 Translation probabilities are computed on a basis of aligned corpora
 In contrast to this the source and target language corpora used by FITE are independent of each other
 In statistical MT bigram and trigram language models are typically used to capture the context
 FITE is based on a unigram language model no context dependence of translations is assumed
 4
2 Frequency Pattern In order to avoid several long function definitions not precisely in the focus of our article we introduce some notational conventions used in the definition of the FITE method
 Notational Convention 1
 Let SL be a source language and TL a target language and sw be some source language word in the source language collection S
 We denote this by sw SL
 We denote the word set produced by our TRT translation by TRT S L T L sw using the transformation rules for SL TL translation
 The result is a set its elements tw hold the relationship tw TRT S L T L sw 
 If the TRT translation is performed using a strict confidence factor 10 and a strict rule frequency 10 see Section 2 we denote this by TRT S L T L strict sw 
 Notational Convention 2
 Let sw be some word in source language SL sw SL
 We denote its document frequency in the source language collection S by df S sw 
 Note that if sw does not appear in any documents of S then df S sw 0
 If S is a source language wordlist containing word frequencies we denote the frequency of sw in S by wf S sw 
 Notational Convention 3
 Let tw be some word of the target language TL in the target language document collection T tw TL
 We denote its document frequency in T by dfT tw 
 It refers to the frequency of target language documents that contain the word tw
 Note that if tw does not appear in any documents of T then dfT tw 0
 If T is a target language wordlist containing word frequencies we denote the frequency of tw in T by wfT tw 
 Notational Convention 4
 Let sw be some source language SL word sw SL TL a target language TWS TRT S L T L sw the word set produced by our TRT translation and T a target language document collection or word list
 The frequency ranked list of words of TWS in T is denoted by R trt frank TWS T 
 Table II is an example of such a list with the frequency data added
 For a given source language word sw we obtain this list by trt frank TRT S L T L sw T 
 The elements of this list are denoted by the usual notation for example trt frank TWS T 3 gives its third component
 As an example in the case of Table II trt frank TRTSPA ENG biosintesis EngWeb 3 biosyntesis
 Its frequency is dfEngWeb trt frank TRTSPA ENG biosintesis EngWeb 3 dfEngWeb biosyntesis 634
 The core of FITE is that except for the translation equivalents the word forms yielded by TRT are malformed rather than real words or they are rare words for example foreign language words in the target language text
 The equivalents belong to a language s basic lexicon and are much more common in the language than the other word forms
 This regular frequency pattern allows the identification of the equivalents
 The example in Table II shows the document frequency pattern associated with the word forms obtained by TRT for the Spanish word biosintesis in Spanish English TRT in the English sub Web
 The word forms are sorted by document frequency by trt frank TRTSPA ENG biosintesis EngWeb 
 We can see that the DF of biosynthesis the equivalent of biosintesis is remarkably higher than the DFs of the other the word forms
 This type of frequency distribution is very common for word forms within a translation set of TRT
 Given a target word form ranking R trt frank TWS T the magnitude of difference between the document frequency of the first word form dfT R 1 and the document frequency of the second word form dfT R 2 or the frequencies between R 2 and R 3 see Section 4
5 forms the basis of the equivalent identification
 We used the coefficient value the magnitude of difference of 10 for the identification of equivalents both for Web and word frequency lists 
 The same pattern holds for the Web and word frequency lists with the main differences being in that in the case of frequency lists word frequencies instead of document frequencies are considered and in that Web gives more malformed words than the frequency lists
 The following definition of the function freqpattern ok checks whether the frequencies of two target language words twi and tw j have the required pattern
 Definition 1
 Let twi and tw j be two candidate word forms in the target language sub Web document collection or word frequency list T as given by TRT
 Let dfT twi and dfT tw j be their frequencies in T 
 Let be a corpus dependent normalizing factor 1
 The Boolean function freq pattern ok gives the value true if the frequency of twi in T is at least times the frequency of tw j in T 
 freq pattern ok twi tw j T true if dfT twi dfT tw j false otherwise
 Typically the function freq pattern ok is applied on two consecutive words in a frequency ranked order
 For example freq pattern ok biosynthesis biosintesis 10 EngWeb yields the value true Table II 
 In the tests the coefficient was experimentally set at 10 using the training data Section 5

3 Relative Frequency There are situations where the highest DF WF is possessed by a word that is not the correct equivalent
 For example the source word may occur frequently in a target language collection if TRT fails to translate the source word it may appear at the first position in a translation set
 A source word is always included in TRT s translation set because source and target language words may be identical
 Also in the case of Web as a document collection there are mixed language pages some of which a search engine may consider target language pages which wrongly increases the target DF of a source word found in the mixed language pages
 TRT may also accidentally give high DF words that are not correct equivalents
 As a solution for this problem we compute relative document frequency rel df and relative word frequency rel wf defined as follows
 Definition 2
 Let sw be a source language word in the source language collection S and tw a target language word form in the target language sub Web document collection T as given by TRT
 Let df S sw be the frequency of sw in S and dfT tw the frequency of the target language word tw in T 
 Let be a corpus dependent normalizing factor 0
 The function rel df gives the relative document frequency for tw in T
 Definition 3
 Let sw be a source language word in the source language word list S and tw a target language word form in the target language word list T as given by TRT
 Let wf S sw be the frequency of sw in S and wfT tw the frequency of the target language word tw in T 
 Let be a corpus dependent normalizing factor 0
 The function rel wf gives the relative word frequency for tw in T
 rel wf tw sw T S wfT tw 
 xwf S sw 
 The coefficient is a corpus dependent normalizing factor
 It is assigned such a value that rel df and rel wf 1 indicate that the target word form is an equivalent and rel df and rel wf 1 indicate the equivalent is not found in the translation set
 The coefficient values reflect the relative sizes of the sub Webs
word frequency lists in relation to each other
 In our case 2 was used in all test conditions
 The value 2 was determined experimentally
 The values of from 1 to 2 are appropriate for the conditions where the target corpus is much larger than the source corpus which was the case in our experiments
 The Finnish word frequency list contains more words than the English list Section 4
1 
 However the sum frequency over all words is substantially higher in the English than Finnish list
 This allows the use of 2 in the rel wf formula also for Finnish English
 The example in Table III illustrates the case where the word with the highest DF is not the correct equivalent
 The translation set contains the word forms and the associated frequencies of English Web pages for a Spanish source word fraccionamiento
 A typical frequency pattern is found
 However fraccionamiento the word with the highest DF is the Spanish source word not translated into English
 Its DF in the Spanish portion of Web is 416 000
 It is not accepted as an equivalent since rel df fraccionamiento fraccionamiento 2 EngWeb SpaWeb 1
 We considered the two highest ranked word forms and naturally also for the second form fraccionamento rel df 1
 4
4 Length Factor Cross lingual spelling variants are close to each other in word length
 A great difference between the length of a target word form and the source word is an indication of a wrong equivalent
 The length factor is taken into account as FITE identifies equivalents
 The length criteria for accepting an equivalent candidate as an equivalent are shown in Table IV
 It can be seen for example that when a source word contains 7 characters the target word form has to have from 5 to 9 characters in order to be accepted as an equivalent
 Definition 4
 Let sw be a source language word and len sw its length in characters
 Likewise let tw be a target language word and len tw its length in characters
 The Boolean function tw len ok gives the value true if the length of the target word tw is within the range defined in Table IV
 tw len ok tw sw true if 4 len tw 7 and len sw 5 true if 5 len tw 8 and len sw 6 true if len tw len sw 2 and 7 len sw 10 true if len tw len sw 3 and len sw 10 false otherwise 4
5 The Application of FITE In the empirical experiments the source test words Section 5
1
1 were translated into English by the TRT translation program
 The applied thresholds were described in Section 2
 The equivalents were searched for from the translation sets using the FITE technique
 As described in Sections 4
2 4
4 the main criteria of equivalent identification of FITE are the following 1 the frequency patterns of the top word forms tested by the function freq pattern ok 2 the relative frequency criterion tested by the rel df
rel wf functions and 3 length criterion tested by the function tw len ok
 The basic idea is to apply the criteria 1 3 in three steps A C First in Step A direct translation is tried and then in Steps B and C the pivot language translations one after the other
 The criteria are first applied to the highest ranking target word candidate as given by the function trt frank
 If these steps do not yield a solution then basically the same steps are repeated with the second highest ranking target word candidate
 This process is specified as Algorithm find equivalent which is presented in the Appendix
 The algorithm is for the case of word frequency lists S and T for the source and target languages
 In the case of Web document collections the word frequency lists are replaced by a function that gives the Web document frequency for a given source word
 The TRT rule bases for the source pivot and target languages as described above need to be available but are not precisely defined see notational conventions in Section 4
2 
 We use the notations and functions of preceding sections in the definition of the algorithm
 The algorithm find equivalent first tries the first candidates produced by the TRT direct or pivoted processes
 It calls the procedure direct trans to produce the frequency based ranking of the direct TRT candidates
 The procedure generates them as the list R and then the first component of R is tested for the criteria 1 3 by the procedure test cand
 If the first component passes the test it is given as the equivalent
 If not the algorithm find equivalent then uses the first and finally the second pivot language translation given by the procedure pivot trans which first checks the number of pivot language word forms obtained
 The TRT rules are used liberally the thresholds of CF 4
0 and frequency 2 are used see Section 2 if there are at most 40 candidates and otherwise strictly the thresholds of CF 10
0 and frequency 10 are used 
 Either way produces a target language word candidate list TWS which then is ranked by frequency and the first component tested for the criteria 1 3
 If the first pass focusing on the first ranked components is not successful then the algorithm find equivalent tries the second equivalent candidate produced by the TRT processes
 The first component is still selected as the equivalent if the three criteria are fulfilled as follows the second component passes the frequency pattern and relative frequency criteria and the first one the length criterion
 The second word form is selected as the equivalent only if the first word form does not meet the length criterion and the second form meets all the three criteria
 Otherwise the source word is indicated to be untranslatable by means of TRT the string nil is returned
 We found empirically the need to compare the second candidate word form to the third form to find out if there are more than one correct target language words high frequency word forms in the translation set
 If there are exactly two acceptable words the first word rather than the second is selected as the equivalent based on our observations that in these cases the equivalent tends to be at the first position
 The second word form is accepted as the equivalent only if the first form does not meet the length criterion
 In the actual experiments described in Section 5 the algorithm findequivalent was applied
modified as follows
 In the case of frequency lists the second pivot language French was not considered
 Finnish English experiments differed from the Spanish English experiments in that there were two direct translation routes thanks to two Finnish English rule collections
 The order of the use of the translation routes for Finnish English was as follows Finnish English
collection 1 Finnish English
collection 2 Finnish GermanEnglish and Finnish French English
 All the source words were in base form and only base form equivalents were accepted as correct equivalents
 Thus equivalents in plural form and the derivatives of the actual equivalents were not accepted as correct equivalents
 This is because our aim is to develop a dictionary like rule based translation method which indicates the precise equivalents of source words
 We conclude this section by summarizing in Figure 1 the FITE TRT process
 The left side of the figure describes the production of transformation rules and the translation of OOV words by means of TRT
 The FITE technique the focus of the present article is the grey shaded area
 FITE TRT effectiveness was evaluated using the measures of translation recall and precision and indication precision

1 Training and Test Word Sets and Translation by TRT
 FITE TRT is intended to handle both spelling variants and native source language words
 The training and test word sets contained both types of words
 Next we describe the selection of training and test words
 Then we characterize quantitatively the difference between cross lingual spelling variants and native words
 We used a training word set for the development of the FITE technique
 The set contained the title words n 75 of the Spanish CLEF topics numbered 91 to 109
 In addition to native Spanish words the titles contain Spanish English spelling variants native English words and English acronyms
 The effectiveness of FITE TRT was evaluated using four sets of test words
 For each source language word set there was a corresponding English word set that contained the equivalents of the source words
 For the first two test word sets a list of English biological and medical terms was gathered manually from the index of CLEF s Peters 2005 LA Times collection
 The English terms were translated into Spanish and Finnish by means of translation dictionaries and monolingual Spanish and Finnish medical dictionaries
 From these words we selected Spanish English and Finnish English spelling variants for our tests
 The identification of spelling variants was done based on the similarity of the Spanish English and Finnish English word pairs judged by a researcher
 The similarity feature used as a selection criterion is discussed in Section 3 and later in this section
 The Spanish terms formed the first and the Finnish terms the second test word set
 Both contained the same terms n 89 albeit in different languages
 These terms are called bio terms
 For the third and fourth test word sets TREC Genomics Track 2004 topics in Spanish and Finnish Section 5
2
1 were translated into English using the UTACLIR system an automatic dictionary based query translation and construction system developed in the Information Retrieval Laboratory at the University of Tampere Hedlund et al
 2004 
 The OOV keys of the UTACLIR runs were used as test words
 Among the OOV keys there were in addition to spelling variants native Spanish
Finnish words as well as English words and English acronyms
 The Spanish word set contained 98 and the Finnish set 53 OOV keys after the removal of short words 
 The difference in the number of the OOV keys reflects the different sizes of UTACLIR s Spanish English and Finnish English dictionaries
 These test key sets are here called OOV UTACLIR SPA ENG and OOV UTACLIR FIN ENG
 Words containing four or less letters were not translated by TRT
 This restriction was set because the short words were English acronyms and they need not be translated
 Generally acronyms cannot be translated by means of TRT which only handles spelling variants
 On the other hand cross lingual spelling variants are not very short words
 Within the four test word sets there were two short 4 letter spelling variants which were removed from the sets according to the short word restriction
 The total number of unique source words translated by TRT was 89 98 Spanish 89 53 Finnish 329 words
 To characterize quantitatively the difference between cross lingual spelling variants and native words we computed for both types of source language test words their degree of similarity with respect to their English equivalents using a simple measure of longest common subsequence divided by the mean length of source and target words LCS
MWL 
 LCS is defined as the length of the longest subsequence of characters shared by two words
 The closer to 1
0 LCS
 MWL is the more similar the words are
 As an example for the Spanish bioterm omnivoro LCS
MWL 7
 8 8

 Table V shows the results of LCS
MWL calculations
 From the viewpoint of TRT the target language English words as source words are similar cases as spelling variants and they were thus regarded as spelling variants in the sets OOV UTACLIR SPA ENG and OOV UTACLIR FIN ENG
 As mentioned in Section 4
3 a source word is included in TRT s translation set because source and target language words may be identical
 In cases where native Spanish and Finnish words had multiple meanings in English the meaning that appeared in the Genomics Track topic was selected for LCS
MWL calculation
 Both the Spanish English and Finnish English OOV word sets contained five native words
 It can be seen in Table V that for bio terms and spelling variant OOV words the average LCS
MWLs are 0
839 and 0
911 Spanish English and 0
784 and 0
853 Finnish English 
 For native Spanish and Finnish words average LCS
MWLs are much lower 0
339 for Spanish and 0
361 for Finnish
 Low standard deviation figures show that the LCS
MWL values are clustered around the average values
 In the experiments the source words were translated by the TRT program through direct and indirect translation routes into English using the confidence factor and rule frequency thresholds Section 2 
 The equivalents of source words were identified from TRT s English translation sets by means of the FITE technique as described in Section 4

 Like target language translation sets the intermediate translation sets are often large and only five top German and French forms in a frequency ranked translation set were further translated into English
 Different English translation sets corresponding to the same Finnish
Spanish source word were combined

2 Findings
 Table VI reports the translation recall and precision results for bio terms and Table VII the contribution of different translation routes to the recall for bio terms
 Table VIII presents the translation recall and precision and indication precision results for OOV UTACLIR SPA ENG and OOVUTACLIR FIN ENG words
 Table VI shows that Spanish English FITE TRT reaches 91
0 recall in the case of Web document frequencies and 82
0 recall in the case of word frequency lists
 Finnish English FITE TRT reaches 71
9 Web and 67
4 frequency lists recall
 While Spanish English FITE TRT achieves higher recall precision is approximately the same and it is remarkably high for both language pairs 97
0 98
8 
 The same trends hold for the OOV words Table VIII for Spanish English recall is higher than for Finnish English and for both language pairs precision is very high 95
0 97
6 
 Table VII shows that the contribution of direct translation to the recall is substantial for both language pairs
 For Finnish English FITE TRT the contribution of the second direct route collection 2 to the recall is high
 Indirect translation adds recall only for Spanish English
 In the case of Web as a frequency corpus the first pivot language adds recall by 6
7 while the second one adds recall only by 2

 For the native words indication precision is 100 in all test situations Table VIII 
 There were only 10 native Spanish and Finnish words in all however the results are reasonable since the cases where TRT accidentally gives correct words are not common

1 Methods and Data
 FITE TRT was applied as part of an actual CLIR system
 As test data we used TREC Genomics Track 2004 data Hersh et al
 2005 
 The data consisted of 50 test topics a subset of the Medline collection containing around 4
5 million documents and relevance judgments
 Queries were formulated on the basis of the Title and Need fields of the topics
 The data are well suited for investigating FITE TRT since the topics are rich in technical mainly biological and medical terms
 The topics were translated manually into Spanish and Finnish by a researcher
 The final Spanish topics were formulated by a knowledgeable Spanish speaker a university teacher of Spanish 
 The researcher is a native Finnish speaker and has expertise in medical informatics
 The test system was the InQuery retrieval system Allan et al
 2000 Larkey and Connell 2005 
 InQuery is a probabilistic retrieval system based on the Bayesian inference network model
 Queries can be presented as a bag of word queries or they can be structured using a variety of query operators
 In this study the translated queries were structured using InQuery s syn operator as described in Pirkola 1998 and Sperer and Oard 2000 
 The keys within the syn operator are treated as instances of one key
 The Spanish and Finnish topics were translated back into English using the UTACLIR system and the queries were then run on the Genomics Track test collection
 UTACLIR s output without any OOV word technique provides crosslingual baseline for the FITE TRT queries for which UTACLIR s OOV words were translated by means of TRT and equivalents were identified using FITE
 The original English queries were also run to show the performance level of the translated queries
 We also compared the effectiveness of FITE TRT queries to the effectiveness of plain TRT and skipgram queries
 Plain TRT is the TRT part of FITE TRT and for plain TRT queries UTACLIR s OOV words were translated by TRT with CF 4 and frequency 2
 All translations of a source word were included in a query and were wrapped in the syn operator
 In skipgram queries the OOV words were translated using a skipgram fuzzy matching technique Keskustalo et al
 2003 
 This string matching technique is a generalization of the n gram technique where words are split into digrams on the basis of both consecutive as well as nonconsecutive characters see below 
 In these comparison experiments only direct translation
matching was examined since it is not sensible to study indirect fuzzy matching
 Also indirect TRT without frequency based selection of intermediate word forms for further translation would give very long queries that would be hard to manage
 The skipgram fuzzy matching technique constructs digrams of both consecutive and nonconsecutive characters of words Keskustalo et al
 2003 
 The generated digrams are put into comparable categories based on the number of skipped characters as digrams are constructed
 The character combination index CCI indicates the number of skipped characters as well as the comparable categories
 Here we used CCI 0 1 2 
 This means that digrams formed of consecutive characters form one comparable category and digrams with one and two skipped characters the other
 CCI 0 1 2 was very effective in the study conducted by Keskustalo et al
 2003 who explored the same general problem as we do in this article the identification of translation equivalents of cross lingual spelling variants
 Skipgrams with CCI 0 1 2 outperformed conventional digrams formed of consecutive characters of words
 In the skipgram experiments each OOV word was matched against each string in the index of the TREC collection
 Two types of queries were constructed for each OOV word 1 two best matches and 2 five best matches were selected for a query
 In the query the best matches were linked to each other with InQuery s syn operator
 All inflected query words were rendered into base form for a dictionary lookup
 For Finnish UTACLIR s morphological analyzer gave base forms for most inflected words and those that the analyzer was not able to handle were lemmatized manually
 All Spanish inflected words were lemmatized manually
 Manual lemmatization of the inflected keys was necessary because at this stage of development TRT only translates lemmas
 Thus the results show CLIR performance when a searcher gives query keys in base form
 The results were tested for significance by the Wilcoxon signed rank test Conover 1980 
 The Wilcoxon test takes into account both the direction and magnitude of change between each comparable result of a query
 In summary we run the following queries in Spanish English and FinnishEnglish CLIR experiments r Original English queries r UTACLIR baseline with OOV words passed through unchanged r UTACLIR FITE TRT Web r UTACLIR FITE TRT frequency lists r UTACLIR TRT r UTACLIR skipgrams with two best matches r UTACLIR skipgrams with five best matches 5

2 Findings
 The results of the retrieval experiments are presented in Tables IX XI
 The statistical significance of the test queries was tested against the UTACLIR baseline Tables IX X and against UTACLIR FITE TRT
Web Table XI 
 In the tables the statistical significance is indicated by asterisks
 As expected the queries where OOV keys are translated by FITE TRT perform better than the baseline queries where OOV keys are retained untranslatable Tables IX and X 
 In Spanish English CLIR MAP improvement percentages are 40
3 Web and 35
2 frequency lists 
 Precision at 20 documents is improved by 50
5 Web and 49
2 frequency lists 
 Also FinnishEnglish FITE TRT queries remarkably outperform the CLIR baseline although performance improvements are smaller than in the case of Spanish English Table X 
 All Spanish English and Finnish English results are statistically significant at p 0
001
 These findings are in agreement with the high number of OOV keys in the UTACLIR runs and FITE TRT s high translation recall and precision
 It should be noted that some OOV words may only be marginally topical in which case correct FITE TRT identification may result in a performance drop
 Therefore FITE TRT performance does not always correlate linearly with CLIR FITE TRT performance
 Spanish English FITE TRT queries perform better than Finnish English FITE TRT queries which were much longer and more ambiguous than SpanishEnglish queries due to the larger coverage of UTACLIR s Finnish English dictionary
 The higher degree of translation ambiguity and FITE TRT s lower performance resulted in lower CLIR performance
 The higher performance of English queries with respect to the performance of Spanish English and in particular Finnish English queries is mostly caused by translation ambiguity
 Table XI shows the performance of FITE TRT TRT and skipgram queries
 The results are ranked based on MAP values
 It can be seen that for both language pairs the best OOV word method is FITE TRT with Web document frequencies
 However it shows significantly better results only against the cases of Spanish English
skipgram
2 and Finnish English
TRT and the results are significant only at p 0
05
 In the latter case the difference in MAP is small 0
2447 0
2393 but systematic and hence significant
 In comparison to UTACLIR baselines Tables IX and X all queries perform well
 It was expected that plain TRT queries yield good results since TRT with CF 4 and frequency 2 very often gives a source word s correct equivalent while the other translations typically are malformed word forms not occurring in the database index and having no effects whatsoever on retrieval results
 In many applications outside cross language document retrieval it is however important to avoid the ambiguity of TRT and obtain one reliable translation as given by FITE TRT

 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS In this study we first examined the following two basic questions
 Regarding spelling variants how to effectively identify the correct equivalent of a source word among the many word forms produced by TRT when most of the transformation rules available for a language pair are used in TRT
 How to reliably identify native source language words source words that cannot be correctly translated by TRT
 We devised the FITE TRT technique a novel OOV word translation technique
 Its effectiveness was tested for Spanish English and Finnish English spelling variants and actual OOV words in the domains of biology and medicine
 Here the research questions were as follows
 What are the translation recall and precision and indication precision of the proposed FITE TRT method
 Are word frequency lists mined from the Web competitive with the Web as a collection of documents as FITE TRT s frequency source
 What is the contribution of each step direct and indirect translation routes in the FITE TRT process to its overall effectiveness
 We found that depending on the source language and frequency source FITETRT may achieve high translation recall
 When equivalents were identified on the basis of Web document frequencies Spanish English FITE TRT achieved 89
2 91
0 recall
 For Finnish English and for frequency lists mined from the Web recall was lower but still substantial
 The lowest recall 67
4 was obtained for Finnish English
frequency lists
 The results indicated that FITETRT achieves high precision
 FITE indicates precisely the equivalents of source words as well as the native words
 For Spanish English and Finnish English test words translation precision was 95
0 98
8 
 All native OOV words were correctly indicated to be untranslatable by TRT
 The test requests only contained 10 native OOV words the results reported here need to be corroborated using a larger set of native words
 The contribution of direct translation to the overall recall was substantial for Spanish English bio terms
 Direct translation achieved 82
0 recall while the overall recall was 91
0 
 We expected that Finnish English FITE TRT through pivot languages would have compensated failures of direct translation but that did not happen
 Indirect translation did not help at all
 These findings suggest that that the costs of indirect translation against its benefits are high
 Because a pivot language increases FITE TRT complexity it does not seem sensible to use two pivot languages as part of a FITE TRT system
 Last we examined the effectiveness of a standard CLIR system boosted by the use of FITE TRT in comparison to a CLIR system augmented with TRT and fuzzy matching OOV word methods and in comparison to dictionarytranslation only CLIR and monolingual baselines
 It was shown that FITETRT with Web document frequencies was the best technique among several approaches to handling OOV words tested in the experiments
 Dictionarybased CLIR augmented with FITE TRT performed substantially better than the baseline where OOV keys were kept intact
 In Spanish English CLIR MAP improvement percentages were 40
3 Web and 35
2 frequency lists 
 Also Finnish English FITE TRT queries remarkably outperformed the CLIR baseline although performance improvements were smaller than in the case of Spanish English about 26 for both Web and frequency lists 
 The TRT program we used in this study was not able to process a high number of word forms in a reasonable time frame and we had to apply CF and frequency thresholds
 In the preliminary tests we translated without using any thresholds and for long words we had to end the program because it was not able to complete the translation process within a day
 We observed that for many source words equivalents were not found in translation sets because the CFs and
or frequencies of the relevant rules were below the thresholds
 We therefore expect that recall values can still be improved by using a more sophisticated TRT program that allows efficient TRT even without the use of thresholds
 For example in the case of Spanish
bio terms
Web there were 81 correct identifications one wrong identification and seven words for which TRT did not identify equivalents
 For five of the seven words equivalents were not contained in the translation sets because of low CF or frequency rules
 The five words and the rules are shown in Table XII
 Also deficiencies in the Finnish English rule collections and word frequency lists caused recall errors
 FITE TRT effectiveness was better for SpanishEnglish than Finnish English
 The better effectiveness can be attributed to the higher quality of Spanish English rule collection
 Deficiencies in the FinnishEnglish transformation rules can be overcome by using more data in rule generation
 The frequency lists we constructed using Web mining turned out to be good frequency data for FITE
 However for some source word
equivalent pairs frequencies were too low for rel wf formula which resulted in a decrease in recall performance
 This deficiency can be overcome by adding more data to the existing lists
 The main advantage of using frequency lists is that after the lists have been constructed FITE TRT is independent of the Web
 This is important when a practical FITE TRT implementation is developed
 The frequency lists we used contain biological and medical terms in accordance with the test terminology used in the study
 The lists are large and contain terms in various domains
 The application of FITE TRT in the other domains may require lists with different types of terms
 However for each domain the lists are concise enough to be held in main memory for efficient implementation
 Overall the percentage of wrong equivalents indicated by FITE was small
 The identification of derivatives and plural forms of the correct equivalents was the primary cause of precision errors
 As an example for the Finnish word leukosyytti and the Spanish word bacteria the correct equivalents are leucocyte and bacterium while FITE gave the words leucocytic and bacteria
 Many of these types of cases could be solved by augmenting the transformation rules with word class information for example that a rule is likely to refer an adjective rather than a noun
 Information on OOV word s word class is achieved when the sentential context of the OOV word is known
 At present TRT is only intended to translate singular base forms
 Word class information is needed if FITE TRT will be applied to running texts containing inflectional word forms
 This would imply the supplementation of rule collections with word class information
 The next main challenge in the FITE TRT research is to improve the rules such that FITE TRT can handle words in a running text
 The CLIR experiments showed that the best fuzzy translation
matchingbased query was FITE TRT with Web document frequencies
 The FITE component of FITE TRT was the focus of this article and here an important issue is its contribution in CLIR
 The results showed that in the case of Finnish English FITE TRT was significantly better than plain TRT but only at p 0
05
 In the case of Spanish English FITE TRT did not show significantly better results
 Overall the results are inconclusive and the issue needs to be investigated more thoroughly in future research
 Such factors as query structure and other than OOV keys affect the effectiveness of FITE TRT and TRT queries
 Also efficiency needs to be taken into account in future research
 TRT queries are much longer than FITE TRT queries and thus require more processing power
 On the other hand the FITE component of FITE TRT increases computational expense
 In other information systems than retrieval systems in particular in MT fuzzy translation TRT does not come into question
 The good quality of translations achieved through FITE TRT suggests that it can contribute to better MT performance
 There is still one CLIR related application of FITE TRT that is worth mentioning an automatic construction of multilingual dictionaries of technical terms and proper names by means of FITE TRT
 The dictionary construction process could be designed to be largely automatic thanks to FITE TRT s high degree of effectiveness
 Given a list of words and a set of transformation rule collections the process would automatically yield the translation equivalents of the words in different languages the result would essentially be a multilingual dictionary
 The construction of dictionaries is a non time critical task given enough time it would be possible to construct large multilingual dictionaries
 The cost benefits of an automatic method are obvious
 It can easily be seen that there is a difference in the cost of automatic as opposed to manual construction of a dictionary of say 10 languages and 50 000 dictionary entries
