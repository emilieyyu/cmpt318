two
approaches
for
supporting

in
complex

are
system-controlled
adaptive

and
user-controlled
adaptable

we
evaluate
a
novel
interface
design
for
feature-rich
productivity
software
based
on
adaptable
menus
the
design
allows
the
user
to
easily
customize
a
personalized
interface
and
also
supports
quick
access
to
the
default
interface
with
all
of
the
standard
features
this
design
was
prototyped
as
a
front-end
to
a
commercial
word
processor
a
field
experiment
investigated
users
personalizing
behavior
and
tested
the
effects
of
different
interface
designs
on
users
satisfaction
and
their
perceived
ability
to
navigate

and
learn
the
software
there
were
two
conditions
a

provided
with
a

the

and
2
user-controlled

as
compared
to
a

introduction
desktop
applications
such
as
word
processors
spreadsheets
and
web
browsers
have
become
woven
into
the
daily
lives
of
many
people
in
the
developed
world
these
applications
have
traditionally
started
small
in
terms
of
functionality
and
have
grown
with
each
new
release
this
phenomenon
sometimes
called
creeping

a

list

seen
as
essential
for
products
to
compete
in
the
marketplace
applications
have
become
more
visually
complex
menus
have
multiplied
in
size
and
number
and
toolbars
have
been
introduced
to
reduce
complexity
but
they
too
have
grown
in
a
similar
fashion
insufficient
attention
has
been
paid
to
the
impact
of
this
functionality
explosion
on
the
user
we
introduce
a
design
that
supports
two
interfaces
between
which
the
user
can
easily
toggle
1
an
interface
personalized
by
the
user
containing
desired
features
only
and
2
the
default
interface
with
all
of
the
standard
features
the
target
for
the
design
is
feature-rich
productivity
applications
used
by
a
diversity
of
users
the
design
has
been
tested
in
a
prototype

to
the

msw2k
and
evaluated
in
a
field
experiment
with
20
participants
the
two
main
goals
of
the
evaluation
were
1
to
understand
the
users
personalization
behavior
with
the
new
design
and
2
to
compare
our
design
to
the
adaptive
interface
of
msw2k
our
choice
of
goals
determined
our
choice
of
methodology
our
first
goal
was
exploratory
in
nature
our
second
goal
was
comparative
there
is
a
distinction
between
controlled
laboratory
evaluation
where
statistical
significance
is
the
norm
and
field
evaluation
where
qualitative
methods
are
given
more
weight
we
have
included
comments
from
participants
during
interviews
which
complement
the
quantitative
data
providing
a
richer
account
of
their
experience
during
the
experiment
our
evaluation
shows
1
when
provided
with
a
flexible
easy-to-use
customization
mechanism
the
majority
of
users
do
effectively
personalize
their
interface
and
2
user-controlled
interface
adaptation
with
our
adaptable
menus
results
in
better
navigation
and
learnability
and
allows
for
the
adoption
of
different

to

design
solutions
to
complex
software
the
traditional
all-in-one
interface
has
menus
and
toolbars
that
are
static
so
every
user
regardless
of
task
or
experience
has
the
same
interface
there
are
a
number
of
alternative
interface
designs
aimed
at
reducing
user
interface
complexity
although
most
have
received
minimal
to
no
evaluation
design
solutions
tend
to
fit
into
one
of
two
categories
1
ones
that
take
a
level-structured
approach
shneiderman
1997
and
2
ones
that
offer
a
personalized
interface
for
each
user
most
commonly
using
artificial
intelligence
a
classic
level-structured
design
includes
two
or
more
interfaces
each
containing
a
predetermined
set
of
functions
the
user
has
the
option
to
select
an
interface
level
but
not
to
select
which
functions
appear
in
that
level
preliminary
research
suggests
that
when
an
interface
is
missing
even
one
needed
function
the
user
is
forced
to
the
next
level
of
the
interface
which
results
in
frustration
mcgrenere
2002
we
address
this
limitation
in
our
design
which
uses
a
level-structured
approach
while
allowing
the
user
to
modify
the
contents
of
one
of
the
levels
there
are
a
small
number
of
commercial
applications
that
provide
a
level-structured
interface
e
g
hypercard
and
framemaker
some
applications
such
as
eudora
provide
a
level-structured
approach
across
versions
by
offering
both
pro
and
lite
versions
such
product
versioning
however
seems
to
be
motivated
more
by
business
considerations
than
by
an
attempt
to
meet
user
needs
the
carroll
and
carrithers
training
wheels
interface
to
an
early
word
processor
adopts
a
level-structured-like
approach
although
there
was
only
one
interface
all
of
the
functionality
that
was
not
needed
for
simple
tasks
was
blocked
off
such
that
when
the
user
clicked
on
a
blocked
function
a
dialog
appeared
indicating
that
the
function
was
unavailable
in
the
training
wheels
system
the
design
had
the
user
progressing
through
two
distinct
phases
after
the
first
phase
the
training
wheels
were
removed
launching
the
user
into
the
full
system
novice
users
were
able
to
accomplish
tasks
significantly
faster
and
with
significantly
fewer
errors
than
novice
users
using
the
full
version
carroll
and
carrithers
1984
despite
the
promise
of
this
early
work
mechanisms
to
support
the
transition
between
the
blocked
and
unblocked
states
were
never
investigated
in
our
design
users
can
move
easily
back
and
forth
between
the
designs
unlike
a
classic
level-structured
user
interface
a
personalized
interface
is
one
that
is
tailored
to
each
individual
user
the
two
main
ways
for
achieving
personalization
are
through
system-initiated
adaptation
namely
adaptive
interfaces
and
through
user-initiated
customization
namely
adaptable
interfaces
these
two
approaches
have
significant
differences
with
respect
to
the
goal
of
reducing
interface
complexity
while
the
broad
goal
of
adaptive
and
more
generally
intelligent
user
interfaces
is
to
assist
the
user
by
offloading
complexity
miller
et
al
1991
a
common
complaint
about
adaptive
interfaces
is
that
they
result
in
the
user
perceiving
a
loss
of
control
dieterich
et
al
1993
fischer
1993
adaptable
interfaces
by
contrast
have
not
typically
been
designed
for
the
purposes
of
reducing
complexity
and
so
they
are
often
difficult
to
use
however
they
do
not
suffer
the
same
user
control
problem
fischer
1993
there
has
been
a
debate
in
the
user
interface
design
community
between
those
who
promote
the
use
of
artificial
intelligence
in
the
interface
and
those
who
promote
comprehensible
predictable
and
controllable
interfaces
that
give
users
the
sense
of
power
mastery
control
and
accomplishment
shneiderman
and
maes
1997
we
briefly
survey
adaptable
and
adaptive
interfaces
in
turn
before
describing
our
design
and
evaluation
in
terms
of
adaptable
interfaces
many
commercial
applications
allow
the
user
to
reconfigure
the
interface
in
predetermined
ways
such
as
by
adding/removing
functions
to/from
the
menus
and
toolbars
and
by
moving
functions
from
one
menu/toolbar
to
another
despite
the
prevalence
of
such
customization
facilities
there
has
been
relatively
little
research
into
their
design
a
common
complaint
however
is
that
the
mechanisms
for
customizing
are
complex
and
can
therefore
require
significant
time
for
both
learning
and
doing
the
customization
thus
only
the
more
sophisticated
users
are
able
to
customize
mackay
1990
1991
found
the
latter
to
be
true
in
the
case
of
unix
customization
she
identified
a
small
group
of
users
which
she
called
the
translators
who
shared
their
customizations
with
the
rest
of
the
organization
others
have
identified
this
role
and
assigned
their
own
names

al

page
et
al
1996
found
that
92
of
participants
in
a
large
field
study
customized
their
word
processor
closer
examination
of
their
work
shows
however
that
a
very
broad
notion
of
customization
was
used
for
example
changing
the
zoom
setting
in
a
dropdown
button
on
the
toolbar
was
considered
a
customization
this
points
to
a
need
for
a
better
understanding
of
the
various
forms
of
customization
in
our
study
customization
is
narrowly
defined
as
adding/deleting
items
to/from
the
menu/toolbar
which
is
at
least
in
many
modern
graphical
user
interfaces
significantly
more
difficult
to
do
than
parameter
adjustments
relative
to
adaptable
interfaces
adaptive
interfaces
have
enjoyed
considerable
attention
by
the
research
community
given
the
breadth
of
work
we
are
unable
to
do
it
justice
in
this
short
review
instead
we
summarize
some
relevant
trends
and
highlight
selected
projects
for
greater
depth
the

referred
to
browne
et
al
1990
and
schneider-hufschmidt

the
topic
more
recent

by

2004
one
well-known
limitation
of
early
work
in
adaptive
interfaces
was
that
it
was
too
technology
focused
systems
were
built
but
relatively
little
user
testing
was
conducted
maybury
and
wahlster
1999
this
can
partially
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
evaluation
of
adaptive
interfaces
is
more
complex
than
that
of
standard
interfaces
there
is
greater
variability
with
adaptive
interfaces
and
the
evaluation
methodology
needs
to
accommodate
this
variability
greenberg
and
witten
1985
maybury
and
wahlster
1999
some
early
examples
of
adaptive
interfaces
include
the
adaptive
telephone
directory
in
which
the
hierarchy
of
names
in
the
directory
adapted
to
the
user
s
interactions
such
that
the
most
frequently
accessed
names
were
located
at
the
upper
levels
of
the
hierarch
and
the
least
frequently
accessed
names
were
located
at
the
lower
levels
greenberg
and

adaptive

augmented
an
interface
by
providing
a
permanently

only
the

appropriate
and

likely
to
be
chosen
actions
based
on
the

to

and
the

on
the
user
s
level
of
expertise
the
eager
system
detected
a
repetitive
activity
and
highlighted
menus
and

on
the
screen
to
indicate
what
it
predicted
the
user
would
do
next
cypher
1991
of
the
adaptive
designs
described
above
there
was
user
testing
reported
for
the
adaptive
telephone
directory
and
eager
for
the
former
the
results
strongly
favoured
the
adaptive
directory
compared
to
a
static
one
user
testing
of
eager
showed
promise
in
its
ability
to
detect
and
highlight
the
correct
menus
and
objects
however
the
most
striking
finding
was
that
all
subjects
were
uncomfortable
with
giving
up
control
when
eager
took
over

37
the
work
on
the
adaptive
telephone
directory
is
a
constrained
example
but
does
provide
an
existence
proof
for
the
efficacy
of
adaptive
interfaces
another
limitation
of
early
adaptive
user
interface
research
is
that
it
focused
largely
on
prototype
systems
thomas
and
krogsoeter
1993
we
note
some
exceptions
here
the
aid
project
included
an
adaptive
front
end
for
the
british
telecom
electronic
mail
system
browne
et
al
1990
among
other
things
it
provided
adaptive
help
based
on
the
user
s
level
of
expertise
via
an
application
expert
user
testing
over
three
half-hour
sessions
each
separated
by
three
days
showed
relatively
poor
results
an
independent
expert
judged
that
only
7
of
the
adaptations
made
by
the
system
based
on
inferred
user
difficulties
and
expertise
were
useful
flexcel
was
a
modified
version
of
ms
excel
that
provided
a
separate
adaptation
toolbar
that
allowed
the
user
to
define
new
menu
entries
and
new
key
shortcuts
for
function
parameterization
krogsoeter
et
al
1994
in
addition
there
were
system-generated
adaptation
suggestions
which
the
user
accessed
at
her
convenience
user
testing
showed
some
acceptance
of
the
adaptation
but
revealed
that
the
transition
between
the
user
accepting
systemdefined
adpation
suggestions
to
actually
initiating
adaptations
him/herself
was
not
satisfactory

user

the
adaptive

to
a
fixed
toolbar
to
which
users
could
somehow
add/delete
functions
showed
that
the
adaptive

improved
performance
for
certain
tasks
and
that
users
were
generally
satisfied
with

by

tasks
no

has
been
reported
we
note
that
all
the
user
testing
mentioned
above
has
been
done
in
the
lab
and
with
the
exception
of
the

it
has

as
seen
above
the
microsoft

suite
of
applications
is
a
common
target
for
adaptive
user
interface
research
it
is
not
surprising
therefore
that
msw2k
introduced
an
adaptive
user
interface
namely
menus
that
adapt
to
each
individual

aims
to
address
a
number
of
the
shortcomings
in

literature
reported

we
compare
an
easy-to-use
adaptable
two-level

that
was
designed
specifically
to
reduce

to
the

overview

1
conceptual
design
what
makes
our
design
unique
is
the
combination
of
three
design
elements
1
there
are
two
interfaces
one
that
is
personalized
the
personal
interface
and
one
that
contains
the
full
set
of
functions
the
full
interface
there
is
a
switching
mechanism
between
interfaces
that
requires
only
a
single
button
click
2
the
personal
interface
is
adaptable
by
the
user
with
an
easy-to-understand
adaptation
mechanism
3
the
personal
interface
begins
small
and
unless
the
user
adds
many
functions
it
remains
a
minimal
interface
relative
to
the
full
interface
the
only
difference
between
the
two
interfaces
is
the
functions
that
are
displayed
visually
in
the
menus
and
toolbars
the
set
of
functions
in
a
particular
menu
in
the
personal
interface
is
always
a
subset
of
those
in
the
same
menu
in
the
full
interface
and
the
relative
ordering
of
functions
is
preserved
thus
the
only
choice
users
make
with
respect
to
their
personal
interfaces
is
whether
or
not
to
include
particular
functions
the
conceptual
design
was
proposed
by
mcgrenere
and
moore
2000
based
on
a
study
of
53
members
of
the
general
population
who
used
msword
97
they
found
that
while
many
users
were
having
a
negative
experience
with
the
feature-richness
of
the
software
the
majority
of
users
would
not
choose
a
word
processor
that
gave
them
only
the
functions
that
they
are
currently
using
users
want
the
ability
to
discover
new
functions
the
proposed
design
allows
users
to
work
in
a
personalized
interface
with
a
reduced
feature
set
while
providing
one-button
access
to
the
standard
interface
with
all
features
by
default
the
personal
interface
is
displayed
when
the
application
is
launched
there
are
several
reasons
for
having
a
user-controlled
personalizable
interface
rather
than
a
predetermined
static
small
interface
not
only
do
users
typically
use
very
few
features

but
the
overlap
between
the
command
vocabulary
of
different
users
is
minimal
even
for
users
in
the
same
group

perform
similar
tasks
and
who
have

the
limited
command
overlap
between
users
suggests
that
determining
appropriate
personal
interfaces
a
priori
is
not
possible
many
users
do
not
take
advantage
of
customization
features
mackay

likely
because
of
complexity
inherent
in
customization
this
is
a
primary
argument
for
an
adaptive
interface
our
goal
has
been
to
make
an
easy-to-understand
adaptable
interface
instead
by
starting
users
with
a
small
personal
interface
users
are
encouraged
to
customize
and
take
control
of
their
interfaces
right
from
the
outset
although
our
proposed
multiple-interface
design
may
seem
at
first
glance
to
be
somewhat
awkward
and
nonintuitive
it
was
motivated
by
our
earlier
research
findings
and
other
results
from
the
literature
the
experiment
was
designed
to
assess
the
effectiveness
of
the
design
and
to
do
a
first
comparison
with
the
adaptive
interface
of

implementation
our
conceptual
design
is
intended
to
generalize
to
any
productivity
application
used
by
a
diversity
of
users
with
a
broad
range
of
tasks
we
chose
to
implement
our
design
as
a
front-end
to
msword
1
because
word
processing
tends
to
be
a
canonical
example
in
hci
research
2
because
msword
is
relatively
easy
to
program
through
visual
basic
for
applications
vba
and
3
because
msword
dominates
in
the
marketplace
so
we
believed
that
participants
would
be
easy
to
find
in
order
to
evaluate
this
design
in
a
field
experiment
with
participants
who
were
already
users
of
msw2k
our
prototype
was
implemented
so
that
it
did
not
interfere
with
any
customization
that
participants
had
already
made
to
their
msword
interface
it
was
also
designed
to
be
easily
installed
on
top
of
an
existing
installation
of
msword
this
was
accomplished
by
placing
the
required
vba
code
in
a
specialized
document
template
that
was
loaded
into
msword
on
each
startup
if
necessary
a
participant
could
remove
the
prototype
by
simply
deleting
this
template
and
re-launching
word
the
information
about
function
availability
in
the
personal
interface
was
stored
in
a
flat
file
enabling
the
prototype
to
be
effectively
stateless
this
would
facilitate
the
quick
reconstruction
of
a
personal
interface
should
a
problem
occur
with
the
software

3
participants
twenty
experienced
msword
users
participated
in
this
evaluation
participation
was
solicited
electronically
through
newsgroups
and
listservs
that
were
broadcast
across
the
university
of
toronto
campus
and
the
surrounding
city
in
order
to
participate
users
had
to
meet
the
following
base
criteria
they
had
to
have
been
using
msw2k
for
at
least
1
month
they
had
to
do
the
majority
of
their
word
processing
on
a
single
computer
they
had
to
spend
a
minimum
average
of
3
hours
word
processing
per
week
they
had
to
have
msword
expertise
above
the
novice
level
they
had
to
be
at
least
20
years
of
age
and
they
had
to
live
at
most
one
half
hour
s
drive
from
campus
in
order
to
ensure
that
these
criteria
were
satisfied
prospective
participants
completed
an
online
screening
questionnaire
ninety-eight
people
completed
this
questionnaire
they
were
considered
in
the
order
in
which
they
applied
a
participant
s
level
of
expertise
was
assessed
with
a
microsoft
office
screening
questionnaire1
that
was
embedded
within
the
online
preliminary
questionnaire
the
screening
questionnaire
categorizes
expertise
into
five
groups
novice
beginner
intermediate
advanced
and
expert
a
particpant
had
to
be
ranked
at
least
as
a
beginner
in
order
to
participate
in
our
evaluation
personality
differences
with
respect
to
feature-rich
software
were
considered
we
included
10
feature-keen
participants
and
10
feature-shy
as
assessed
by
an
instrument
developed
by
mcgrenere
and
moore
2000
a
person
is
categorized
as
feature-keen
feature-neutral
or
feature-shy
based
on
his/her
response
to
statements
about
1
having
many
functions
in
the
interface
2
the
desire
to
have
a
complete
version
of
msword
i
e
not
a
lite
version
and
3
the
desire
to
have
an
up-to-date
version
of
msword
there
was
no
sampling
frame
of
the
user
population
available
to
us
so
we
weren
t
able
to
achieve
a
simple
random
sample
that
is
a
representative
sample
we
have
therefore
described
our
sample
because
it
may
suggest
limits
to
generalizability
an
aggregate
description
of
the
participants
is
found
in
table

the
participants
are
described
individually
in
table
ii
independent
samples
t-tests
showed
that
there
were
no
statistically
significant
differences
between
the
feature-shy
and
feature-keen
participants
in
terms
of
gender
distribution
age
education
msoffice
expertise
or
number
of
years
using
msword
there
were
however
a
number
of
attributes
of
our
sample
that
lead
us
to
believe
that
it
was
not
fully
representative
on
average
the
participants
appeared
to
be
highly
educated
a
rating
of
5
equals
the
completion
of
an
undergraduate
degree
and
long-term
users
of
msword
there
were
no
administrative
assistants
roles
that
clearly
include
many
users
who
do
word
processing
although
an
earlier
study
we
conducted
did
include
them
we
do
not
have
a
definitive
reason
why
we
did
not
get
participants
in
these
roles
perhaps
the
call
for
participation
did
not
reach
these
groups
or
they
were
reached
but
individual
users
did
not
feel
that
they
could
participate
in
this
evaluation
another
likely
point
of
difference
between
our
sample
and
a
representative
sample
is
that
graduate
students
make
up
one
quarter
of
the
participants
this
is
easily
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
call
for
participation
was
sent
to
newsgroups
on
a
university
campus
4
experiment
protocol
we
prioritized
our
two
main
evaluation
goals
as
follows
1
to
understand
the
participants
personalization
behavior
with
the
new
design
2
to
compare
our
design
to
the
adaptive
interface
of
msw2k
a
commercial
interface
design
for
feature-rich
software
given
this
prioritization
a
field
experiment
was
chosen
instead
of
a
laboratory
experiment
because
it
was
expected
that
true
personalizing
behavior
would
be
significantly
more
likely
to
occur
with
users
doing
their
own
tasks
in
their
normal
work
context
rather
than
in
a
lab
setting
with
prescribed
tasks
that
would
likely
be
artificial
and
unfamiliar
to
the
extent
that
it
was
possible
we
did
introduce
some
controls
in
the
experiment
and
so
our
protocol
is
best
described
as
a
quasi-experimental
design
2
there
are
several
differences
between
the
two
interface
designs
that
we
compared
most
notably
the
degree
of
user
control
of
customization
and
the
use
of
a
dual
versus
single
interface
as
will
become
evident
our
study
was
not
designed
to
tease
these
factors
apart
we
instead
elected
to
examine
the
overall
efficacy
of
an
adaptable
approach
using
the
combination
of
factors
that
we
believed
offered
the
best
alternative
to
the
existing
adaptive
interface
isolating
the
impact
of
each
factor
once
we
were
able
to
show
that
the
features
together
offer
an
advantage
is
an
obvious
next
step
each
participant
was
involved
for
approximately
6
weeks
they
used
msw2k
prior
to
the
start
of
the
evaluation

with
our
new
design
for
4
weeks
and
returned
to
msw2k
for
the
remaining
2
weeks
participants
met
with
the
experimenter
on
three
occasions
and
completed
a
series
of
short
on-line

in-depth
semi-structured

interview
was
conducted
with

given
to
the
participants
in

of
the

participants
were
only
told
that
some
changes
would
be
made
to
their
word
processing
software
but
they
were
not
told
the
nature
of
the
changes
at
the
first
meeting
they
were
told
that
a
new
version
of
the
software
had
been
installed--msw
personal--which
contained
two
interfaces
the
experimenter
toggled
between
the
two
interfaces
once
as
a
brief
demonstration
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
personal
interface
contained
very
few
functions
initially
but
that
functions
could
be
added
or
deleted
with
the
modify
button
the
process
of
personalizing
however
was
not
demonstrated
participants
were
told
that
there
was
no
right
or
wrong
way
to
use
the
interfaces
and
it
was
specifically
mentioned
that
they
could
choose
to
use
just
one
of
the
two
interfaces
and
essentially
ignore
the
other
or
they
could
switch
between
the
interfaces
in
any
way
that
suited
their
needs
participants
were
not
told
that
msw
personal
would
be
uninstalled
at
the
second
meeting
the
impression
intended
was
that
it
would
be
used
for
the
entire
duration
of
the

we
were

personalization
behavior
with
multiple-interfaces
design
we
wanted
to
understand
whether
users
could
use
the
msword
personal
design
effectively
effectiveness
relates
to
being
able
to
personalize
according
to
command
usage
in
a
way
that
is
not
overly
cumbersome
we
also
wanted
to
see
whether
msword
personal
is
sufficiently
flexible
to
accommodate
a
variety
of
personalization
strategies
h1
usage
hypothesis
the
majority
of
the
participants
will
choose
to
use
their
personal
interface--they
will
find
the
personalizing
mechanism
easy
to
use
intuitive
and
flexible
enough
such
that
they
will
use
the
mechanism
to
include
all
frequently
used
functions
and
will
spend
the
majority
of
their
time
in
their
personal
interface
h2
approaches
to
personalization
hypothesis
the
multiple-interfaces
design
will
allow
for
different
approaches
to
personalization
individual
differences
feature-shy
vs
feature-keen
will
influence
the
strategies
adopted
h3
growth
of
personal
interface
hypothesis
modifications
to
participants
personal
interfaces
will
be
dominated
by
additions
and
the
size
of
the
personal
interfaces
will
reach
a
steady
state
users
will
not
continually
need
to
modify
their
personal
interfaces
h4
modification
triggers
hypothesis
related
to
growth
there
will
be
identifiable
triggers4
that
prompt
participants
to
modify
their
personal
interface
for
example
and
most
obviously
there
will
be
an
initial
trigger
to
add
functions
because
the
personal
interface
will
otherwise
be
almost
unusable
the
last
hypothesis
while
not
directly
related
to
effectiveness
and
flexibility
was
deemed
important
because
if
such
triggers
could
be
identified
they
could
provide
a
design
basis
for
user-assisted
personalization

comparison
to
adaptive
interface
we
hypothesized
about
how
the
multiple-interfaces
design
of
msw
personal
compares
to
one
particular
instance
of
an
adaptive
design
namely
msw2k
while
we
expected
differences
in
satisfaction
we
also
expected
that
because
users
operate
within
a
small
individually
constructed
interface
they
would
find
navigation
easier
and
would
feel
a
greater
overall
sense
of
control
with
msw
personal
we
also
expected
the
ability
to
learn
features
would
be
positively
impacted
because
operating
in
a
user-controlled
small
interface
acts
as
a
training
wheels
interface
to
the
full
interface
with
many
of
these
hypotheses
we
expected
individual
differences
to
play
a
role

adding

took
the
approach
of
adding

and
then
gradually
adding

this
meant

days

these

the

could
but
would
then
switch
to
the

was
obvious
from
his
comments
in

that
he
really
did
not
understand
the
concept
of

by

we

hypothesis
in
order

we

by
identifying
the
patterns
of

with
respect
to

in
particular
whether
a

was
used
before
or
after
it
was
added
and
if
so
how
soon
it
was
used
before
or
after
if
was
added
a
detailed
analysis
of
these
usage
patterns
enabled
us
to
define
four
triggers
for
addition
immediate-need
trigger
the
user
has
an
immediate
need
to
use
a
function
that
is
not
currently
in
his/her
personal
interface
and
therefore
adds
it
this
is
shown
clearly
in
the
log
file
by
the
pattern
add
function
x
followed
directly
by
use
function
x
initial
trigger
the
user
desires
to
add
functions
when
first
using
msw

any
function
added
within
the
first
2
days
of
usage
that
does
not
satisfy
the
immediate-need-trigger
satisfies
this
trigger
previously-used
trigger
the
user
has
already
used
a
function
and
expects
to

summarizes
our
findings
with
respect
to
triggers
for
the
addition
of
functions
we
see
that
the
initial
trigger
and
the
immediate-need
trigger
together
accounted
for
almost
86
of
the
functions
added
the
previously
used
and
future-use
triggers
accounted
for
the
addition
of
the
remaining
functions
which
were
typically
added
while
an
immediately-needed
function
was
being
added
there
were
two
triggers
for
deletion
mistaken-addition
trigger
a
function
was
added
by
mistake
it
was
not
intended
or
was
the
wrong
function
non-use

a
function
is
not
being
used
only
3
participants
deleted
a
combined
total
of
seven
functions
one
two
and
four
functions
respectively
in
all
seven
cases
the
function
was
deleted
directly
after
it
was
added
when
queried
in
the
debriefing
interview
the
participant
who
had
deleted
four
functions
indicated
that
she
had
been
testing
the
personalizing
mechanism
and
the
other
2
participants
said
that
the
deleted
functions
had
initially
been
added
by
mistake
thus
the
mistaken-addition
trigger
applied
to
the
deletion
of
three
functions
and
the
non-use
trigger
did
not
apply
to
any
deleted
functions
one
might
initially
assume
that
the
lack
of
the
non-use
trigger
is
explainable
by
the
fact
that
msw
personal
was
only
used
for
one
month
to
counter
this
however
the
great
majority
of
participants
indicated
in
the
debriefing
interview
that
they
would
not
likely
have
bothered
to
delete
functions
even
if
they
were
not
being
used
finally
to
double
check
that
our
participants
were
not
simply
customizing
when
reminded
of
their
study
participation
we
investigated
a
potential
correlation
between
the
times
when
subjects
personalized
their
interfaces
and
times
when
questionnaires
were
due
for
questionnaires
q1
and
q2
68
and
63
of
the
subjects
respectively
did
perform
at
least
one
customization
on
the
days
when
those
questionnaires
were
answered
this
is
not
surprising
however
given
the
minimal
starting
personal
interface
and
the
strong
initial
trigger
excluding
customization
that
overlapped
with
q1
and
q2
there
was
only
an
average
17
3
overlap
of
customization
with
q3
through
q6
n
19
if
we
consider
only
those
who
didn
t
give
up
that
average
is
only
slightly
higher
at
20
1
n
12
thus
the
data
suggests
that
personalization
was
not
being
triggered
by
questionnaire
completion
but
was
done
at
various
times
during
the
roughly
six
days
preceding
the
days
when
each
of
the
q3
q4
q5
and
q6
questionnaires
were
answered
summary
the
initial
trigger
accounted
for
the
majority
of
additions
77
when
participants
added
an
immediately
needed
function

they
would
typically
also
add
a

they
expected
to

had
already
used

hypothesis
supported
yes
discussion
and
additional
qualitative
feedback
here
we
discuss
our
findings
about
personalization
behavior
and
specifically
how
the
multiple-interfaces
design
impacted
this
behavior
we
include
selected
comments
made
by
the
participants
about
msw
personal
both
from
the
open-ended
sections
in
questionnaires
q1
through
q8
and
in
the
final
debriefing
interview
the
goal
is
to
bring
the
quantitative
data
to
life
by
placing
it
in
the
context
of
the
qualitative
data
approach
to
personalization
msword
personal
appears
to
provide
sufficient
flexibility
to
allow
users
to
personalize
as
they
see
fit
of
the
13
participants
who
did
not
give
up
there
was
almost
an
even
distribution
between
the
four
combinations
of
when
and
which
frequently-used
upfront
2
frequently-used
as-you-go
4
all
upfront
4
all
as-you-go
3
we
speculate
that
this
flexibility
played
a
key
role
in
the
success
of
the
multiple-interfaces
design
having
said
that
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
none
of
the
participants
who
took
the
approach
of
adding
functions
upfront
ended
up
giving
up
this
suggests
that
personalizing
upfront
may
be
a
more
effective
strategy
than
as-you-go
user-assisted
personalization
four
participants
suggested
having
some
automated
assistance
in
the
construction
of
their
personal
interfaces
but
some
of
them
did
acknowledge
loss
of
control
as
a
potential
negative
side
effect
interestingly
the
quote
below
is
from
participant
7
he
was
annoyed
by
the
adaptive
menus
and
yet
he
was
still
hopeful
that
the
personal
interface
could
be
built
automatically
so
if
i
could
have
something
where
it
automatically
creates
the
personal
based
on
my
use
without
having
to
point
and
click
buttons
around
which
is
easy
enough
but
a
bit
of
a
pain
if
it
automatically
could
do
it
for
me
so
that
over
time
i
created
a
personal
interface
by
default
so
my
usage
pattern
creates
it
without
that
annoying
short
menu
stuff
that
would
be
nice
because
then
i
wouldn
t
actually
have
to
think
about
it
i
d
just
use
word
and
it
would
create
it
as
i
go
interview
participant
7
it
is
not
yet
clear
whether
fully
automated
interface
construction
is
effective
but
user-assisted
personalization
has
potential
knowledge
about
customization
triggers
should
play
a
role
in
how
the
assistance
is
designed
we
return
to
this
topic
in
the
final
section
of
this
paper
role
of
the
full
interface
we
checked
whether
having
the
full
interface
was
considered
important
customizable
interfaces
do
not
generally
provide
easy
access
to
the
entire
set
of
functionality
except
through
a
full
reset
which
results
in
loss
of
the
customization
effort
we
found
that
having
the
full
interface
was
generally
well
liked
while
there
were
two
participants
who
did
not
make
use
of
it
at
all
the
great
majority
did
use
it
at
least
once
and
appreciated
having
it
available
example
representative
comments
include
i
d
always
want
to
have
the
full
interface
to
go
to
just
as
like
a
baseline
kind
of
thing
because
that
word
the
full
interface
was
there
it
was
this
safety
net
of--yah
i
know
it
s
over
there
if
i
ever
do
need
it
anyways
interview
participant
11
i
like
the
security
blanket
of
having
the
full
interface
but
over
a
longer
period
of
time
i
probably
would
have
extinguished
my
use
of
it
pretty
much
interview
participant
17
what
i
would
really
hate
is
if
the
personal
one--if
you
couldn
t
go
back
and
forth
the
fact
that
you
could
back
and
forth
and
that
it
was
so
easy
to
go
back
and
forth
that
was
very
good
interview
participant
13
so
although
our
evaluation
did
not
assess
an
easy-to-customize
personal
interface
in
the
absence
of
an
easy-to-access
full
interface
our
data
suggests
that
the
full
interface
is
an
integral
part
of
the
design
and
that
personalizing
behavior
would
be
significantly
altered
without
having
a
full
interface
available
initial
personal
interface
we
initialized
the
personal
interface
to
be
small
with
the
goal
of
forcing
customization
two
participants
felt
that
the
personal
interface
should
have
initially
included
more
functions--those
functions
that
are
used
by
everyone
for
example
if
there
was
an
interface
maybe
it
differs
by
industry
i
don
t
know
but
with
the
most
common
functions--like
print
everyone
prints
everyone
makes
things
bold
so
if
there
was
a
kind
of
pre-selected
simple
menu
that
wasn
t
overwhelming
i
would
maybe
be
tempted
to
prefer
something
like
that
like
it
would
make
my
decision
harder
to
decide
should
i
use
the
full
2000
interface
or
the
personal
interface
and
then
be
able
to
switch
that
distinction
would
be
a
little
less
clear
in
my
mind
so
if
there
was
a
pre-selected
bunch
of
functions
that
everyone
happens
to
use
and
i
happen
to
fit
into
that
everyone
category
interview
participant
3
the
implicit
assumption
by
these
participants
is
that
such
a
set
exists
research
by
greenberg
into
unix
command
usage
showed
however
that
there
is
only
minimal
command
overlap
even
between
participants
within
the
same
group
who
are
performing
similar
tasks
greenberg
1993
we
expect
that
similar
results
would
be
found
for
msword
command
usage
7
but
additional
research
would
be
required
to
substantiate
that
claim
assuming
for
the
moment
the
existence
of
a
reasonable
set
of
functions
that
could
be
used
to
initialize
the
personal
interface
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
how
personalizing
behavior
might
change
with
such
a
relatively
large
initial
personal
interface
on
the
one
hand
users
would
not
have
to
take
the
time
to
do
any
initial
customization
on
the
other
hand
users
would
not
be
taking
ownership
of
their
personal
interfaces
from
the
outset
which
could
diminish
their
overall
engagement
in
the
personalization
process
another
possible
research
avenue
would
be
to
investigate
appropriate
initial
personal
interfaces
based
on
individual
differences
feature-keen/shy
usability
of
msword
personal
our
participants
identified
some
basic
usability
improvements
to
the
implementation
of
the
personalizing
mechanism
three
participants
commented
that
it
was
somewhat
cumbersome
the
confirming
dialog
box
that
appears
after
the
selection
of
each
function
was
seen
to
be
unnecessary
for
example
the
double
menu
that
you
get
i
found
confusing
a
little
bit
but
it
was
easy
to
use
it
s
a
little
clunky
interview
participant
17
i
mean
it
wasn
t
difficult
it
was
just
you
had
to
click
and
you
had
to
click
again
and
click
again
and
go
back
and
go
forth--it
was
just
bulky
interview
participant
22
three
participants
wanted
to
be
able
to
add
an
entire
menu
at
once
the
current
design
requires
each
menu
item
to
be
added
one
at
a
time
and
because
of
the
number
of
steps
involved
this
can
be
time
consuming
if
the
majority
of
a
menu
is
desired
four
participants
felt
that
msw
personal
was
a
good
start
but
in
addition
to
simply
selecting
a
subset
of
functions
for
their
personal
interfaces
they
wanted
to
be
able
to
restructure
the
menu
hierarchies
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
rewrite
the
stupid
menu
structure
of
the
ms
word
program
not
just
select
the
options
that
i
want
within
the
stupid
tree
structure
q4
participant
7
i
would
have
liked
to
put
things
in
different
places
you
know
and
this
is
bad
because
i
do
this
in
word
because
i
don
t
like
what
they
have
decided
is
on
this
menu
interview
participant
11
both
of
these
participants
were
surprised
when
they
were
informed
at
the
end
of
the
evaluation
that
this
restructuring
functionality
was
available
through
msword
s
native
customization
facility
it
is
worth
noting
that
these
comments
were
made
by
participants
7
and
11
both
of
whom
are
expert
longterm
users
of
msword
one
participant
requested
the
ability
to
have
more
than
two
interfaces--she
wanted
different
personal
interfaces
related
to
the
different
tasks
she
performed
one
thing
that
would
have
been
cool
is
if
i
could
have
had
different
settings
like
if
you
have
the
default
word
and
then
a
personal
because
i
work
on
charts
and
i
work
on
just
regular
reports
if
i
could
have
two
kind
of
different
settings--say
this
is
going
to
be
my
flowchart
settings
and
those
would
have
draw
all
the
draw
and
shape
tools
and
everything
and
then
this
is
my
report
interface
and
that
would
just
have
regular
stuff
that
would
have
been
cool
and
i
don
t
know
if
a
lot
of
people
work
like
that
because
sometimes
i
m
just
writing
reports
or
writing
proposals
and
stuff
like
that
and
then
other
times
i
m
just
doing
very
different
things
and
i
need
to
switch
my
orientation
around
and
like
have
all
this
drawing
stuff
and
that
just
doesn
t
fit
with
regular
writing

our
design
goal
for
the
customization
mechanism
was
to
make
it
straightforward/understandable
so
we
opted
for
a
design
that
offered
only
basic
functionality
adding/deleting
functions
and
that
could
be
learned
quickly
through
trial
and
error
despite
the
comments
above
all
participants
noted
how
easy
it
was
to
use
the
addition/deletion
mechanism
thus
we
believe
that
it
was
easy
to
use
in
the
sense
that
it
was
easy
to
figure
out
what
to
do
and
no
errors
occurred
but
there
were
too
many
steps
required
one
participant
pinpointed
our
trade-off
the
add/delete
procedure
seems
slow
and
redundant
for
some
reason
but
is
rather
idiot-proof
we
could
rectify
the
clunkiness
by
removing
the
confirmation
dialog
box
and
designing
a
new
form
of
menu
such
that
when
the
user
is
selecting
items
from
a
menu
to
add
to
the
personal
interface
the
menu
stays
open
and
check
boxes
appear
adjacent
to
each
item
indicating
its
availability
in
the
personal
interface
currently
in
order
to
add
a
menu
item
the
user
selects
the
item
as
in
normal
menu
usage
after
selection
the
menu
disappears
and
the
user
must
reopen
the
menu
in
order
to
add
another
item
we
believe
that
personalization
was
affected
by
the
design
of
the
personalizing
mechanism
some
participants
would
not
likely
have
given
up
if
functions
could
have
been
added
more
quickly
some
wanted
more
flexibility
but
to
support
menu
hierarchy
restructuring
and
more
than
one
personal
interface
would
likely
make
the
personalizing
mechanism
inaccessible
to
nonadvanced
users
the
native
msword
customization
facility
does
allow
for
some
of
this
but
relative
to
our
personalizing
mechanism
it
requires
substantially
more
skill
to
use
we
had
expected
the
flexibility
ratings
recorded
in
the
questionnaires
to
reflect
the
limitations
of
the
personalizing
mechanism
but
the
participants
rated
flexibility
4
0
out
of
5
0
so
although
some
users
did
articulate
preferences
for
additional
flexibility
the
quantitative
data
shows
that
the
mechanism
was
sufficiently
flexible
for
most
participants
one
alternative
design
to
explore
would
be
two
levels
of
customization
basic
and
advanced
greater
flexibility
would
be
available
through
the
advanced
level
but
users
would
by
default
start
in
the
basic
level
individual
differences
the
expected
differences
between
the
feature-shy
and
the
feature-keen
participants
did
not
play
out
in
any
substantial
way
in
how
they
personalized
and
used
msw
personal
and
what
they
had
to
say
about
their
experience
using
it
significant
differences
between
the
two
groups
of
participants
did
appear
however
in

of
how
msw

was

adaptive

the
adaptive
menus
of

were
liked
by
some
and
strongly
disliked
by
many
but
others
had
little
opinion
either
way
there
were
three
participants
who
ranked
the
adaptive

in

first
two
had
very
positive
comments
when
asked
if
they
were

if

love
that
it

i
know
how
they
work
it
seems
that
the
functions
that
you
use
most
often
are
the
ones
that
show
up
or
i
don
t
know
if
they
are
the
ones
that
i
use
most

or
the
ones
that
are

one
out

actually
i
don

think
it
is
the
ones
that
i
use

think
that
it
is

and
then
you
click
on

and
the
whole

comes
up

participant

it
seems
like
it
just
responds
to
whatever

use

recently
it
gives
you
the
most
recent

or
whatever
i
like
that
kind
of

because
it
is
more
dynamic
and
it
just
seems
that
i
am
always
changing
what
i
am

interview
participant
10
interestingly
both
participants
were
expert
long-term
users
of
msword
and
although
they
were
aware
of
the
adaptive
menus
neither
of
them
could
fully
explain
how
they
worked
participant
22
suspected
that
the
menus
adapted
to
her
usage
but
then
questioned
whether
this
was
right
participant
10
knew
that
they
were
adapting
but
implied
that
there
was
a
maximum
number
of
items
that
could
be
shown
when
in
fact
if
one
had
used
all
of
the
menu
items
recently
they
would
all
appear
in
the
short
menu
this
suggests
that
the
user
does
not
have
to
fully
understand
the
conceptual
model
of
an
adaptive
interface
in
order
to
be
satisfied
with
the
interface
if
the
adaptation
works
well
enough
then
understanding
the
underlying
mechanics
is
not
important
at
least
for
some
users
there
were
seven
participants
who
had
very
negative
experiences
of
the
adapting
menus
the
first
comment
below
refers
to
the
ordering
of
items
when
the
menu
expands
from
the
short
version
to
the
long
one
if
a
desired
item
is
not
found
in
the
short
menu
then
a
user
will
likely
have
to
rescan
the
full
long
menu
because
the
newly-visible
items
are
interspersed
with
those
that
have
already
been
scanned
this
usability
problem
might
be
fixed
by
highlighting
the
newly-visible
items
in
such
a
way
that
they
would
be
scanned
first
i
don
t
know
why
i
dislike
the
adaptive
menus
because
i
know
that
well
i
have
some
idea
why
but
well
okay
first
of
all
part
of
the
advantage
of
having
these
mega
menus
is
that
you
can
hunt
through
them
and
i
realize
that
the
stuff
you
use
more
tends
to
show
up
at
the
top
but
when
you
click
the
open
the
adaptive
menus
the
menu
shows
up
in
the
way
it
is
normally
so
if
there
s--if
you
use
two
functions
and
they
are
right
side
by
side
and
then
there
s
actually
a
bunch
of
stuff
in
between
that
will
show
up
in
between
and
so
i
find
it
s
like
i
have
to
start
all
over
again
looking
through
the
menus
for
the
functionality
which
i
find
really
annoying
and
i
don
t
know
why
it
s
confusing
i
just
find
it
more
confusing
i
think
that
s
ultimately
it
and
i
don
t
think
of
myself
as
a
na
ve
user
and
i
don
t
know
why
it
bothers
me
so
much
it

never

q7
participant
11
well
the
first
thing
is
with
the
word
2000--i
really
really
really
dislike
the--
i
mentioned
this
with
my
questionnaire
before--the
frequency
of
use
menu
i
was
often
making
mistakes
and
because
they
only
give
you
i
don
t
know
a
fixed
number
maybe
six
menu
items
i
tend
to
use
a
lot
of
different
functions
regularly
all
of
the
time
so
i
was
always
you
know
using
that
little
piece
down
arrow
icon
and
i
was
always
making
a
mistake
going--where
is
it
where
is
it
where
is
it
it
s
gone
it
fell
off
i
found
that
just
i
still
find
that
incredibly
frustrating
so
i
would
rather
not
do
that
and
word
personal
didn
t
do
that
so
i
much
prefer
it
interview
participant
16
four
additional
participants
felt
negatively
about
the
adaptive
menus
but
not
to
the
same
extreme
as
the
previous
seven
participants
for
example
i
don
t
really
feel
one
way
or
another
about
that
in
fact
i
d
rather
it
didn
t
do
that
because
sometimes
i
forget
like
i
m
looking
for
something
and
i
m
like--
oh
i
can
t
find
it
where
is
it
and
i
can
t
find
it
because
it
s
a
hidden
thingy
interview
participant
6
one
participant
did
appreciate
having
only
some
options
visible
through
the
shortened
menus
but
ultimately
found
that
msw
personal
provided
a
better
balance
for
him
this
feeling
that
you
will
forget
that
certain
functions
are
there
if
you
leave
the
adaptive
menus
turned
on
but
also
the
menus
are
way
too
long
if
you
leave
everything
on
i
e
adaptive
menus
turned
off
so
that
you
have
the
full
menu
so
it
s
a
balance
between
the
two
that
s
why
the
personal
gave
me
the
balance
i
wanted
interview
participant
17
to
summarize
13
participants
expressed
opinions
about
the
adaptive
menus
in
msw2k
for
two
participants
these
menus
worked
very
well
they
were
very
strongly
disliked
by
seven
and
four
were
mildly
negative
one
possible
explanation
is
that
the
adaptive
model
behind
the
menus
provided
a
better
fit
for
the
usage
patterns
of
the
two
satisfied

for

while
using
msw
personal
and
the
feature-keen
did
not
experience
any
significant
difference
one
way
this
can
be
interpreted
is
that
msw
personal
appears
to
have
improved
satisfaction
and
sense
of
control
for
the
feature-shy
without
negatively
affecting
the
feature-keen
once
they
had
used
msword
personal
for
4
weeks
the
feature-shy
were
able
to
achieve
a
comparable
level
of
satisfaction
and
perceived
control
to
the
feature-keen
this
suggests
that
through
the
redesign
of
the
user
interface
we
can
improve
the
experience
of
one
group
of
users
without
negatively
affecting
the
experience
of
another
group
navigation
the
comparison
of
the
q1
and
q6
data
showed
a
strong
effect
of
navigation
for
both
the
feature-shy
and
the
feature-keen
some
of
our
participants
specifically
noted
the
time
savings
when
there
were
fewer
options
to
navigate
through
in
the
menus
and
toolbars

comments

like
having

very
frequently
on

if
i
so

i
haven

used

find

i

it

be

god
just
too
many
buttons

i
don
t
think
that
microsoft
does
a
really
good
job
of
making
their
icon
match
what
the

actually
does

i
will
sit
there
and
i
will
have
to
hover
over
the

and
wait
for
the
explanation
to
come
up
and
it
s
like
oh
man
what
a
waste
of
time
so
that
s
when
i
d
find
myself
getting
like
okay
i
don
t
need
all
this

it
s
too
hard

the

that
s
when

switch

to
the

these
comments
suggest
that
the
difference
in
navigation
between
msword
personal
and
msw2k
is
not
a
subtle
difference
learnability
when
participants
were
asked
to
assess
the
learnability
of
the
multiple-interfaces
design
and
the
adaptive
design
in
questionnaires
q1
to
q7
the
multiple-interfaces
design
had
significantly
higher
ratings
in
the
debriefing
interview
however
the
all-in-one
style
interface
was
presented
as
an
option
alongside
the
other
two
interfaces
fifteen
participants
indicated
that
the
all-in-one
interface
was
best
and
the
standard
reason
given
was
that
seeing
all
of
the
menu
items
all
of
the
time
gives
one
a
sense
of
what
is
available
and
thereby
promotes
learning
the
available
functions
some
participants
specifically
mentioned
learning
through
exploration
two
representative
comments
are
2000
without
the
changing
menus
is
best
just
because
you
can
see
all
of
your
options
so
you
know
what
all
of
the
features
are
interview
participant

i
want
to
learn
them
all
or
nothing
in
general
i
think
that
if
they
are
there
you
are
more
likely
to
say--what
is
this
--and
use
it
so
maybe
a
little
bit
because
i
have
explored
the
only
way
i
ve
learned
to
use
the
program
is
by
playing
with
it
so
i
saw
the
indexes
and
i
went--how
do
you
do
that
--so
now
i
know
how
to
make
an
index
i
guess
if
i
never
saw
it
i
d
probably
never
have
played
with
it
interview
participant
22
two
participants
indicated
that
having
everything
available
in
the
full
interface
within
msw
personal
supported
learning
equally
as
well
as
did
the
allin-one
interface
they
did
not
need
to
be
accessing
the
full
menus
all
of
the
time
i
think
if
i
can
switch
to
the
full
interface
like
that
it
s
very
convenient
so
i
think
the
learning
ability
in
msw
personal
shouldn
t
be
impacted
just
one
click

i
want
it
all
or
i
want
mine
personal
interface
in
the
same
way
i
don
t
want
the
computer
deciding
what
it
s
going
to
show
me
i
want
to
decide
myself
if
i
don
t
know
how
to
do
something
then
i
want
to
go
and
use
the
full
interface
more
as
like
a
reference
or
something
and
have
it
all
kind
of
there
interview
participant
11
two
participants
indicated
that
they
learn
through
exploration
but
that
they
are
not
in
exploratory
mode
all
of
the
time
having
a
personal
interface
forced
them
to
take
ownership
of
learning
as
they
actively
decided
when
to
enter
exploratory
mode
by
switching
to
the
full
interface
for
example
i
think
the
one
with
the
adaptive
menus
doesn
t
support
it
learning
at
all
because
it
just
disappears
on
you
and
you
don
t
even
know
that
it
is
there
i
would
say
that
it
is
probably
similar
between
the
regular
word
long
menu
and
the
personal
one
because
you
still
have
to
think
that
you
need
something
different
and
find
it
often
my
strategy
around
that
is
that
somebody
says--oh
try
this--
or--there
must
be
a
way
to
do
this--and
then
go
to
help
or
whatever
what
about
learning
by
remembering
labels
you
have
seen
in
the
long
menus
that
s
not
been
my
experience
myself
i
must
say
that
whether
it
s
the
personal
sort
of
thing
or
the
long
menus
for
me
at
least
it
s--oh
i
have
to
go
exploring
i
m
going
to
go
look
because
with
your
sort
of
routine
daily
functions
i
am
not
using
the
menus
i
m
not
paying
attention
to
the
menus
so
i
m
not
in
explore
mode
i
m
not
even
in
attentive
mode
i
wouldn
t
even
notice
if
i
ve
seen
something
related
or
not
so
i
wouldn
t
usually
notice
interview
participant
16
none
of
the
participants
thought
that
the
adaptive
menus
best
supported
learning
which
is
a
strong
statement
understanding
learnability
is
a
rich
area
for
further
research
our
participants
certainly
did
not
perceive
that
minimalist
interfaces
provide
scaffolding
for
learning
we
saw
no
general
perception
of
a
training
wheels
effect
carroll
and
carrithers
1984
the
adaptive
interface
provides
minimalist
short
menus
and
they
were
ranked
last
for
learnability
by
all
of
our
participants
while
five
participants
ranked
the
adaptable
interface
first
the
majority
thought
that
allin-one
best
supported
learning
one
possible
next
step
would
be
to
evaluate
the
learnability
afforded
by
these
different
interfaces
with
novice
users
and
to
use
objective
measures
of
learning
rather
than
self
reports
we
did
not
include
any
novice
users
in
our
study
cost/benefit
trade-off
to
personalization
personalization
can
be
framed
in
terms
of
a
cost/benefit
trade-off
9
the
goal
is
that
the
cost
of
personalizing
time
attention
away
from
primary
task
will
be
outweighed
by
the
benefits
of
personalizing
we
have
already
mentioned
some
of
the
benefits
which
include
reduced
navigation
time
we
note
here
that
some
of
the
participants
were
analogously
very
aware
of
the
costs
for
example
the
cost
to
set
up
the
personal
interface
the
personal
interface
is
an
interesting
concept
but
seems
time
consuming
to
completely
set
up
i
am
still
adding
features
to
it
q3
participant
18
initial
configuration
was
time-consuming
but
it
is
ok
if
it
only
must
be
done
once
q8
participant
16
another
cost
is
the
additional
complexity
added
to
the
interface
while
the
goal
of
multiple-interfaces
is
to
allow
users
to
work
predominantly
in
a
simplified
interface
there
is
additional
functionality
that
needs
to
be
included
in
the
interface
in
order
to
make
this
possible
for
some
that
cost
dominated
the
thing
is
for
me
was
that
i
want
my
software
to
be
pretty
much
invisible
to
me
and
the
personal
required
more
visibility
than
i
would
have
liked
it
interview
participant
13
for
others
however
the
benefit
clearly
dominated
i
think
something
like
that
msw
personal
should
be
made
available
it
s
a
nice
thing--it
s
a
nice
interface
i
mean
you
know
i
don
t
know
how
easy
it
would
be
to
be
available
to
many
people
i
guess
that
you
would
have
to
package
it
or
whatever
but
it
was
a
nice
addition
i
actually
enjoyed
it
interview
participant
15
i
think
that
word
xp10
needs
a
personal
edition
even
more
than
2000
q8
participant
17
i
would
like
to
have
personal
re-enabled
on
my
machine
q8
participant
16
thus
for
some
users
even
if
the
cost
to
personalizing
was
relatively
high
there
was
sufficient
benefit
derived
from
a
personal
interface
to
make
it
worthwhile
for
others
the
cost
outweighed
the
benefit
the
difficulty
for
design
is
that
the
perceived
cost
and
benefit
are
both
dependent
on
individual
users
and
difficult
to
determine
a
priori
overall
interface
preference
msword
personal
was
preferred
by
the
majority
of
our
participants
seven
feature-shy
and
six
feature-keen
having
such
strong
support
by
the
feature-keen
was
unexpected
however
as
noted
above
the
two
groups
of
participants
differed
in
their
second
ranking
only
two
of
the
feature-shy
ranked
adaptive
before
all-in-one
as
compared
to
seven
of
the
feature-keen
this
can
perhaps
be
explained
in
part
by
the
fact
that
six
of
the
seven
participants
who
were
unaware
of
the
adapting
short
menus
were
feature-shy
participants
this
indicates
that
lack
of
knowledge
that
adaptation
is
taking
place
likely
contributes
to
overall
dissatisfaction
with
an
adaptive
interface
interestingly
of
the
13
participants
who
expressed
an
opinion
about
the
adaptive
menus
beyond
a
simple
ranking
only
two
were
positive
yet
three
participants
ranked
adaptive
first
and
9
ranked
it
second
so
adaptive
menus
did
have
supporters
the
imbalance
in
the
comments
about
these
menus
suggests
that
those
who
disliked
the
menus
had
a
more
extreme
or
passionate
dislike
as
compared
to
those
who
liked
the
menus
the
implication
for
user
interface
design
could
be
that
even
if
a
design
works
sufficiently
well
for
a
large
part
of
the
user
population
if
that
same
design
is
perceived
by
others
in
the
user
population
to
work
very
poorly
the
negative
views
will
dominate
not
surprisingly
the
group
of
13
participants
who
ranked
personal
first
is
almost
identical
to
the
group
of
13
who
did
not
give
up
on
their
desired
approach
to
personalization
one
participant
who
didn
t
give
up
did
not
rank
msw
personal
first
and
one
participant
who
did
give
up
did
rank
it
first
given
that
this
group
spanned
the
possible
personalization
strategies
it
suggests
that
flexibility
of
personalization
played
a
role
in
the
interface
ranking
users
have
the
ability
to
personalize
when
they
want
and
what
they
want
in
msword
personal
there
is
no
such
flexibility
in
msw2k
which
implements
a
single
personalization
strategy
independence
of
variables
one
might
argue
that
our
dependent
measures
of
satisfaction
navigation
control
and
learning
are
at
least
somewhat
related
to
our
independent
variable
of
personality
type
feature-keen
and
feature-shy
for
example
it
may
not
be
entirely
surprising
that
the
feature-shy
were
significantly
less
satisfied
than
the
feature-keen
with
msw2k
at
the
time
that
q1
was
administered
after
all
msw2k
is
a
feature-rich
application
there
was
another
independent
variable
however
namely
the
two
interface
conditions
it
is
the
impact
of
those
conditions
on
the
dependent
measures
that
is
most
interesting
in
the
findings
we
have
reported
in
this
section
the
results
of
this
evaluation
are
promising
however
there
were
inherent
limitations
and
constraints
to
the
experiment
design
that
may
have
affected
the
results
four
threats
to
validity
in
our
experiment
are
1
reactive
effect
participants
were
fully
aware
of
their
participation
in
the
experiment
and
some
may
have
adjusted
their
interactions
and
responses
2
multiple-treatment
interference
participants
were
exposed
to
two
versions
of
msword
and
there
were
likely
effects
of
having
used
one
version
that
were
not
erasable
when
using
the
second
3
researcher
interference
a
single
researcher
performed
the
role
of
the
experimenter
for
this
experiment
there
may
have
been
something
specific
to
the
particular
researcher
that
systematically
affected
the
results
4
selection
bias
participants
were
a
self-selected
group
because
we
did
not
have
a
sampling
frame
of
all
msw2k
users
and
therefore
could
not
draw
a
simple
random
sample
the
best
way
to
ensure
that
there
wasn
t
anything
incidental
in
our
experiment
execution
that
determined
the
results
would
be
to
replicate
the
experiment
ideally
we
would
want
to
conduct
a
longer
field
experiment
with
a
different
person
acting
in
the
researcher
role
counterbalancing
the
order
in
which
software
versions
are
used
would
be
ideal
in
addition
using
a
different
application
whether
it
be
another
word
processor
or
another
general
productivity
application
would
go
a
long
way
to
ensuring
the
generalizability
of
the
results
to
the
class
of
word
processing
applications
or
general
productivity
applications
as
a
whole
8
conclusions
and
future
work
we
conclude
with
some
final
thoughts
about
msword
personal
adaptive
versus
adaptable
designs
individual
differences
user
assisted
personalization
and
other
scenarios
of
use
for
multiple
interfaces
designs
msword
personal
the
multiple-interfaces
design
of
msword
personal
performed
very
well
in
our
field
evaluation
unlike
previous
work
by
mackay
1991
which
showed
that
users
customize
very
little
the
majority
of
our
participants
did
personalize
and
they
did
so
according
to
their
function
usage
the
fact
that
msw
personal
offers
a
new
style
of
interface
unfamiliar
to
all
our
participants
and
requires
effort
to
use
did
not
preclude
the
majority
of
participants
65
ranking
it
first
preferring
it
to
both
the
adaptive
interface
of
msw2k
or
an
all-in-one
style
interface
we
expect
that
had
it
been
possible
to
add
functions
faster
even
more
participants
would
have
ranked
personal
first
that
almost
as
many
of
the
feature-keen
6
participants
as
the
feature-shy
7
participants
ranked
personal
first
is
particularly
encouraging
adaptive
vs
adaptable
despite
the
breadth
of
research
into
adaptive
user
interfaces
there
has
been
relatively
little
empirical
comparison
between
adaptive
and
adaptable
interfaces
and
to
date
all
investigations
have
been
relatively
short
laboratory
experiments
e
g
debevc
et
al
1996
our
experiment
allowed
us
to
compare
one
instance
of
each
of
these
design
alternatives
in
the
context
of
a
commercial
software
application
with
users
carrying
out
real
tasks
in
their
own
environment
results
favored
the
adaptable
design
but
the
adaptive
interface
definitely
had
support
the
adaptable
design
implemented
in
msword
personal
combines
several
design
elements
two
interfaces
one
personal
interface
one
full
interface
a
simple
toggle
to
switch
between
the
interfaces
an
easily
adaptable
personal
interface
under
full
user
control
and
a
small
initial
personal
interface
the
interface
of
msw2k
by
comparison
has
a
single
interface
which
is
adapted
solely
by
the
system
with
the
exception
that
the
user
can
easily
open
a
short
menu
into
a
long
menu
our
evaluation
did
not
isolate
the
effects
of
the
different
interface
design
elements
although
where
possible
we
did
get
qualitative
feedback
on
those
elements
our
findings
suggest
that
msw
personal
was
preferred
to
msw2k
because
user-controlled
interface
adaptation
results
in
better
navigation
and
learnability
and
allows
for
the
adoption
of
different
personalization
strategies
as
compared
to
system-controlled
interface
adaptation
which
implements
a
single
strategy
because
there
were
several
differences
between
the
two
conditions
compared
we
do
not
assert
that
two
interfaces
are
always
better
than
one
nor
that
adaptable
is
always
better
than
adaptive
a
2
2
experimental
design
comparing
one/two
interfaces
by
adaptive/adaptable
would
be
required
to
tease
this
apart
we
did
not
do
this
for
the
reasons
given
earlier
based
on
the
qualitative
feedback
in
our
evaluation
however
we
strongly
believe
that
the
two-interface
aspect
of
msw
personal
was
a
key
contributing
factor
to
its
success
it
allowed
users
the
flexibility
to
adopt
different
personalization
strategies
we
did
in
fact
observe
different
personalization
strategies
we
note
that
the
effect
of
the
dual
interface
namely
support
to
easily
move
back
and
forth
between
a
personalized
interface
and
an
interface
with
default
settings
could
have
been
achieved
through
a
single-button
factory
reset
operation
if
the
reset
was
undoable
at
any
time
by
the
user
we
believe
that
conceptually
this
model
would
be
more
difficult
for
users
especially
novices
to
understand
and
trust
informative
next
steps
in
the
research
include
comparing
only
two-interface
designs
one
where
the
personal
interface
is
under
user
control
and
the
other
where
it
is
under
system
control
as
well
as
comparing
a
two-interface
design
to
a
factory
reset
model
that
achieves
the
same
outcome
but
with
a
different
conceptual
model
for
the
user
more
recent
laboratory
research
investigating
adaptive
designs
shows
conflicting
evidence
findlater
and
mcgrenere
2004
found
that
adaptive
split
menus
sears
and
shneiderman
1994
were
slower
than
static
split
menus
and
slower
than
adaptable
split
menus
in
most
circumstances
subjects
also
preferred
the
adaptable
menus
to
both
the
static
and
adaptive
ones
gajos
et
al
2006
found
an
adaptive
interface
to
be
faster
than
a
static
one
but
no
adaptable
alternative
was
evaluated
they
also
suggest
some
reasons
for
the
conflicting
evidence
for
example
the
frequency
with
which
adaptations
occur
but
more
work
is
needed
to
tease
these
issues
apart
alpert
et
al
2003
investigated
user
attitudes
regarding
a
user-adaptive
e-commerce
website
and
found
that
users
were
unenthusiastic
toward
system
attempts
to
infer
user
needs
and
provide
adapted
content
accordingly
a
strong
desire
to
have
full
and
explicit
control
of
the
content
and
interaction
was
expressed
jameson
and
schwarzkopf
2002
compared
adaptable
and
adaptive
systems
for
adding
items
to
a
hotlist
for
a
conference
web
site
while
there
was
no
performance
difference
anecdotal
evidence
showed
that
some
subjects
strongly
preferred
the
adaptive
system
while
others
strongly
preferred
the
adaptable
individual
differences
the
existence
of
individual
differences
with
respect
to
software
features
is
an
idea
that
has
been
proposed
in
the
literature
kaufman
and
weed
1998
mcgrenere
and
moore
2000
but
has
undergone
minimal
evaluation
based
on
our
research
it
appears
to
have
construct
validity
one
of
the
most
interesting
observations
is
that
while
there
were
no
substantial
differences
between
the
feature-keen
and
the
feature-shy
participants
in
terms
of
how
they
used
the
two
interfaces
and
how
they
approached
the
task
of
personalizing
there
were
a
number
of
differences
observed
in
terms
of
the
self-reported
measures
the
feature-shy
felt
more
satisfied
and
experienced
a
greater
sense
of
control
with
msw
personal
than
with
msw2k
whereas
there
were
no
differences
detected
for
the
feature-keen
on
these
measures
further
work
is
required
to
validate
the
instrument
used
to
assess
the
individual
differences
and
to
understand
how
this
aspect
of
personality
relates
to
other
well-documented
personality
differences
user-assisted
personalization
in
order
to
shift
the
cost
benefit
ratio
of
personalization
one
needs
to
increase
the
benefit
and
decrease
the
cost
benefit
can
be
increased
by
ensuring
that
the
personalized
interface
is
always
a
good
fit
for
the
user
and
that
the
cost
is
minimal
one
way
to
achieve
both
of
these
is
for
the
system
to
assist
the
user
in
personalizing
the
system
provides
adaptation
suggestions
based
on
usage
information
and
allows
the
user
to
accept
or
reject
the
suggestions
this
moves
the
design
in
the
direction
of
user-assisted
personalization
that
relies
on
user-modeling
technology
this
was
sometimes
called
user-controlled
self
adaptation
in
the
early
literature
dieterich
et
al
1993
and
more
recently
mixed-initiative
interaction
horvitz
1999
the
advantage
of
this
approach
is
that
the
user
retains
ultimate
control
and
the
system
does
the
bookkeeping
to
manage
the
knowledge
of
function
usage
and
changing
patterns
in
usage
a
task
at
which
the
system
is
particularly
adept
this
approach
has
been
investigated
by
others
for
example
in
flexcel
krogsoeter
et
al
1994
and
the
adaptive
toolbar
debevc
et
al
1996
both
with
mixed
user
testing
results
this
research
was
conducted
over
10
years
ago
but
has
not
been
commercialized
it
has
recently
resurfaced
in
the
research
community
lim
et
al
2005
miah
et
al
1997
suggesting
that
further
exploration
of
mixed-initiative
interaction
is
underway
key
aspects
of
ongoing
research
will
be
to
inform
how
and
when
to
provide
personalization
suggestions
in
terms
of
when
we
know
from
the
current
study
that
there
was
both
a
strong
initial
trigger
to
add
functions
and
a
need
to
amortize
the
cost
of
customizing
an
immediately-needed
function
by
at
the
same
time
adding
functions
that
are
expected
to
be
used
in
the
future
these
trigger
points
would
be
naturally
occuring
user
behaviors
upon
which
user-assisted
personalization
research
could
build
other
scenarios
for
multiple
interfaces
we
believe
the
concept
of
multiple
interfaces
has
potential
beyond
the
level-structured
design
seen
today
in
some
commercial
applications
a
possible
scenario
of
use
for
multiple
interfaces
is
to
support
users
making
the
transition
to
a
new
version
of
an
application
for
example
msw2k
could
include
the
msw
97
interface
often
users
delay
upgrading
their
software
because
of
the
time
required
to
learn
a
new
version
by
allowing
users
to
continue
to
work
in
their
old
interface
with
single-button
access
to
a
new
interface
users
would
be
able
to
transition
at
a
self-directed
pace
multiple
interfaces
might
also
be
used
to
mimic
a
competitor
s
interface
in
the
hopes
of
attracting
new
customers
for
example
msword
could
offer
the
full
interface
of
a
different
word
processor
such
as
wordperfect
or
vice-versa
with
a
single
button
click
in
order
to
support
users
making
the
transition
to
a
new
product
in
all
three
scenarios
help
facilities
could
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
both
interfaces
are
accessible
to
show
the
user
how
functions
in
one
interface
map
to
functions
in
the
second
interface
this
is
a
good
example
of
how
the
adaptable
nature
of
a
multiple
interface
design
leaves
the
user
more
in
control
of
the
interface
we
believe
this
is
especially
important
during
critical
transitions
such
as
from
novice
to
experienced
user
from
one
version
of
a
product
to
the
next
and
from
one
product
to
a
competing
or
replacement
product
there
are
of
course
other
interface
differences
beyond
menus
and
toolbars
that
need
to
be
considered
for
the
multiple-interface
paradigm
this
too
is
an
area
for
future
work
