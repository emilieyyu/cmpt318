wbi
programs
which
have
been
increasingly
developed
in

are
used
by

therefore
individual

are
key
factors
for
the
development
of

among
various
dimensions
of
individual

the
study
presented
in
this
article
focuses
on
cognitive

more
specifically
this
study
investigates
how
cognitive
styles
affect
students
learning
patterns
in
a
wbi
program
with
an
integrated
approach
utilizing
both
traditional
statistical
and
data-mining
techniques
the
former
are
applied
to
determine
whether
cognitive
styles
significantly
affected
students
learning
patterns
the
latter
use
clustering
and
classification
methods
in

of

the
k-means
algorithm
has
been
employed
to
produce
groups
of
students
that
share
similar
learning
patterns
and
subsequently
the
corresponding
cognitive
style
for
each
group
is
identified
as
far
as
classification
is
concerned
the
students
learning
patterns
are
analyzed
using
a

with
which
eight
rules
are
produced
for
the
automatic
identification
of
students
cognitive

based
on
their

the
results
from
these
techniques
appear
to
be
consistent
and
the
overall
findings
suggest
that
cognitive

have
important
effects
on
students

within

the
findings
are
applied
to
develop

introduction
with
the
rapid
development
of
information
technology
the
world
wide
web
web
contains
an
enormous
amount
of
information
liaw

2006
in

there
has
been
considerable
growth
in
the
use

2003
web-based
instruction
wbi
has
become
increasingly
attractive
to
educational
settings
both
for
financial
and
technological
reasons
brotherton

these
include
easy
updating
of

and
the
realization
of
a
learner-centered
design
approach
jolliffe
et
al
2001
the
learner-centered
design
is
especially
important
because
wbi
programs
are
used
by
a
diverse
population
of
learners
who
have
far
more
heterogeneous
backgrounds
in
terms
of
their
background
skills
and
needs
soloway
and
pryor
1996
chen
and
macredie
2004
this
type
of
design
argues
that
the
development
of
an
instruction
program
should
be
based
on
the
learners
point
of
view
soloway
et
al
1996
and
should
address
the
needs
of
learners
quintana
et
al
2000
paying
attention
to
learner
diversity
has
been
shown
to
increase
student
motivation
to
learn
which
in
turn
may
lead
to
improved
learning
performance
larkin-hein
and
budny
2001
therefore
individual
differences
arguably
become
an
important
consideration
a
number
of
learnercentered
studies
have
shown
that
individual
differences
have
a
strong
impact
on
the
use
of
instruction
technology
marchionini
1995
an
analysis
of
existing
pedagogical
studies
also
confirms
that
the
successful
usage
of
instructional
technology
depends
on
the
technology
itself
and
the
learners
individual
characteristics
chou
and
wang
2000
for
these
reasons
research
into
individual
differences
has
mushroomed
over
the
past
decade
the
examined
differences
include
cognitive
styles

wang

mitchell

2005
among
these
differences
cognitive
style
has
been
identified
as
one
of
the
most
pertinent
factors
because
it
refers
to
a
user
s
information
processing
habits
representing
an
individual
user
s
typical
mode
of
perceiving
thinking
remembering
and
solving
problems
messick
1976
it
has
also
been
suggested
that
teachers
should
assess
the
cognitive
styles
of
their
students
in
order
to
design
instructional
strategies
for
optimal
learning
lee

in
this
vein
this
study
investigates
a
specific
research
question
what
are
the
effects
of
students
cognitive
styles
on
their
learning
patterns
within
a
webbased
instruction

over
the
past
five
years
this
issue
has
been
investigated
by
a
number
of

while
their

they

represent
the

of
what
might
be
obtained
by

one
of
which
is
data

also
known
as

techniques
from
a

of
fields
including
information
technology
statistical
analyses
and
mathematic
science
bohen

2003
a
major
function
of
data
mining
is
to
help
analyze
understand
or
even
visualize
the
huge
amount
of
data
stored
in

recent

suggest
that

is
a
useful

cognitive

traditional
computer-based
instruction
programs
present
information
in
a
linear
fashion
wbi
programs
employ
hypermedia
techniques
which
have
great
potential
for

learners
are
offered
a
rich
exploration
environment
and
have
freedom
for
navigation
it
can
be
argued
that
when
learners
are
given
the
opportunity
to
move
freely
through
a
wbi
program
they
are
able
to
develop
their
own
learning
patterns
whose
features
can
reflect
their
cognitive
styles
chen
and
ford
1998
terrell
2002
in
other
words
differences
in
cognitive
styles
may
lead
to
distinctive
learning
patterns
cognitive
styles
refer
to
how
individuals
prefer
to
organize
and
represent
information
riding

rayner
1998
there
are
many
dimensions
to
cognitive
styles
such
as
visualized
versus
verbalized
right-brained
versus
left-brained
global-holistic
versus
focused-detailed
or
field-dependent
versus
field-independent
among
these
dimensions
field
dependence/-independence
has
emerged
as
one
of
the
most
widely
studied
dimensions
with
the
broadest
application
to
problems
of
education
messick
1976
witkin

1977
because
it
reflects
how
well
a

is
able
to
restructure

based
on
the
use
of
salient
cues
and

arrangements
weller
et

1994
the
key
issue
of
field
dependence
lies
in
the
differences
between
field-dependent
and
field-independent
learners
which
are
presented
here
--field
independence
these
individuals
tend
to
exhibit
more
individualistic
behaviors
since
they
are
not
in
need
of
external
referents
to
aide
in
the
processing
of
information
they
are
more
capable
of
developing
their
own
internal
referents
and
restructuring
their
knowledge
are
better
at
learning
impersonal
abstract
materials
are
not
easily
influenced
by
others
and
are
not
overly
affected
by
the
approval
or
disapproval
of
superiors
--field
dependence
these
individuals
are
considered
to
have
a
more
social
orientation
than
field-independent
persons
since
they
are
more
likely
to
make
use
of
externally
developed
social
frameworks
they
tend
to
seek
out
external
referents
for
processing
and
structuring
their
information
are
better
at
learning
material
with
human
content
are
more
readily
influenced
by
the
opinions
of
others
and
are
affected
by

approval
or
disapproval
of
authority

it
is
still
inconclusive
whether
field-independent

have
different
learning
patterns
in
addition
these
studies
mainly
relied
on
traditional
statistics
which
in
turn
might
produce

a

might
cause
some
relevant
relationships
to
be
ignored

what

appear
in

and
whether
cognitive

is
a
major
factor
influencing

human
factors
such
as

and

the

clustering
a
major
exploratory
data
analysis
method
eda
tukey
1977
is
concerned
with
the
division
of
data
into
groups
of
similar
objects
each
group
called
a
cluster
consists
of
objects
that
are
similar
among
themselves
and
dissimilar
to
objects
of
other
groups
roussinov
and
zhao
2003
this
approach
has
the
advantages
of
uncovering
unanticipated
trends
correlations
or
patterns
and
no
assumptions
are
made
about
the
structure
of
the
data
wang
et
al
2004
have
developed
a
recommendation
system
for
the
cosmetic
business
in
the
system
they
segmented
the
customers
by
using
clustering
algorithms
to
discover
different
behavior
groups
so
that
customers
in
the
same
group
would
have
similar
purchase
behavior
the
goal
of
classification
is
to
construct
a
classification
procedure
from
a
set
of
cases
whose
classes
are
known
so
that
such
a
procedure
can
be
used
to
classify
new
cases
liu
and
kellam
2003
in
other
words
classification
can
be
used
both
to
understand
existing
data
and
to
predict
how
new
cases
will
behave
for
example
ng

tan
2003
brown
et
al
2000
and
mateos
et
al
2002
used
classification
to
infer
the
functions
of
genes
association
rules
that
were
first
proposed
by
agrawal
and
srikant
1994
are
mainly
used
to
find
out
the
meaningful
relationships
between
items
or
features
that
occur
synchronously
in
databases
this
approach
is
useful
when
one
has
an
idea
of
the
different
associations
that
are
sought
this
is
because
one
can
find
all
kinds
of
correlations
in
a
large
dataset
cunningham
and
frank
1999
applied
the
association
rules
to
the
task
of
detecting
subject
categories
that
co-occur
in
transaction
records
of
books
borrowed
from
a
university
library
a
number
of
techniques
are
available
to
support
these
tasks
including
decision
trees
the
k-means
algorithm
the
support
vector
machine
and
selforganization
maps
among
these
the
k-means
algorithm
and
decision
trees
have
been
widely
used
to
analyze

the
k-means
algorithm
is
an
algorithm
that
can
support
tasks
for
clustering
see

for
the
details
this
algorithm
was
applied
in
the
study
of
wiwattanacharoenchai
and
srivihok
2003
that
clustered
customer
segments
from
web
logs
of
various
internet
banking
web
sites
consequently
their
results
showed
that
there
was
a
clear
distinction
between
the
segments
in
terms
of
customer
behavior
a
similar
study
was
conducted
by
chaimeun
and
srivihok
2005
who
combined
the
k-means
algorithm
with
self

maps
to
cluster
handicraft

in
addition
baeza-yates
et
al
2004
used
the
k-means
algorithm
to
discover
clusters
that
define
textual
contexts
for
the

on
the

decision

can
easily
be
used
for
performing
classification
tasks
see

for
the
details
this
technique
was
used
in
the

agent
to
model
a

s
interests
for

selections
and
to
explore
different

features
for
better
recommendations
kim

2002
also
used
the
decision
tree
to
develop
personalized
recommendation
procedure
for
an
internet
shopping
mall
furthermore
ayan

2002
used
the
decision
tree
to
develop
a
technique
for
automatically
defining
logical
domains
on
the
basis
of
web
page
metadata
in
addition
to
the
aforementioned
evidence
that
suggests
the
k-means
algorithm
and
decision
trees
can
provide
effective
approaches
to
examining
the
web
usage
data
another
advantage
of
these
two
techniques
is
that
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
they
work
see

and
the

moreover
they
are
supported
by

thus
are
easily

a
wbi
program
was
created
containing
materials
from
the
computation
and
algorithms
module
the
program
included
about
75
pages
and
the
content
was
divided
into
six
sections
interface
elements
included
a
a

design
of
this
wbi
program
the
design
of
this
wbi
program
was
underpinned
by
considerations
of
free
exploration
of
the
instructional
material
the
wbi
program
provided
the
students
with
rich
links
within
the
text
as
well
as
a
variety
of
navigation
tools
including
a
hierarchical
map
an
alphabetical
index
and
a
main
menu
in
addition
each
topic
was
further
split
into
four
display
options
comprising
a
to
allow
students
to
control
the
selection
of
the
contents
they
wish
to
learn
to
allow
students
to
choose
one
of
the
display

that
covers
the

c
examples
and
d

there
were
two
types
of
overview
a
general
content
overview
and
an
overview
for
each
specific
topic
in
this
way
the
learners
were
given
control
of
deciding
their
own
learning
paths
and
choosing
their
favorite
navigation
tools
and
preferred

cognitive
style
analysis
the
cognitive
style
dimension
investigated
in
this
study
was
the
level
of
field
dependence
a
number
of
instruments
have
been
developed
to
measure
field
dependence
including
the
group
embedded
figures
test
geft
by
witkin
et
al
1971
and
the
cognitive
styles
analysis
csa
by
riding
1991
the
main
advantage
of
csa
over
geft
is
that
fielddependent
competence
is
positively
measured
rather
than
being
inferred
from
poor
field-independent
capability
ford
and
chen
2001
in
addition
the
csa
offers
computerized
administration
and
scoring
and
consequently
has
been
selected
as
the
instrument
for
measuring
field
dependence
in
this
study
the
csa
includes
two
subtests
figure

the
first
presents
items
containing
pairs
of
complex
geometrical
figures
that
the
individual
is
required
to
judge
as
either
the
same
or
different
the
second
presents
items
each
comprising
a
simple
geometrical
shape
such
as
a
square
or
a
triangle
and
a
complex
geometrical
figure
as
in
the
geft
the
individual
is
asked
to
indicate
whether
or
not
the
simple
shape
is
contained
in
a
complex
one
by
pressing
one
of
two
marked
response
keys
riding
and
grimley
1999
these
two
subtests
have
different
purposes
the
first
subtest
is
a
task
requiring
the
field-dependent
capacity
conversely
the
second
subtest
requires
the
disembedding
capacity
associated
with
field
independence
the
csa
measures
what
riding
and
sadler-smith
1992
refer
to
as
a
wholist/analytic
wa
dimension
noting
that
this
is
equivalent
to
field
dependence/independence
as
witkin
et
al
1971
argued
a
field-independent
individual
is
capable
of
a
more
analytical
cognitive
function
than
a
field
dependent
individual
who
uses
a
more
global
approach
riding
s
1991
recommendations
are
that
wa
scores
below
1
03
denote
field-dependent
individuals
wa
scores
of
1
36
and
above
denote
field-independent
individuals
and
students
scoring
between
1
03
and
1
35
are
classed
as
intermediate
in
this
study
categorizations

experiment
design
the
experiment
took
place
in
a
uk
university
a
request
was
issued
to
students
in
lectures
and
further
by
email
making
clear
the
nature
of
the
experiment
and
their
participation
the
students
took
part
in
the
experiment
a
voluntary
basis
the
experiment
consisted
of
two
phases
held
on
different
days
seventy-six
participants
took
part
in
the
first
phase
of
the
experiment
and
they
were
asked
to
take
riding
s
csa
test
to
classify
their
cognitive
styles
once
this
was
done
they
were
requested
to
fill
out
a
questionnaire
which
was
designed
to
identify
their
personal
background
including
their
gender
the
levels
of
their
prior
knowledge
to
subject
content
and
the
levels
of
their
previous
system
experience
in
using
computers
the
internet
and
computer-aided
learning
the
purpose
of
these
activities
was
to
select
the
sample
for
the
next
phase
based
on
the
participants
previous
system
experience
and
their
prior
knowledge
of
the
subject
content
sixty-five
students
who
had
the
basic
computing
and
internet
skills
necessary
to
operate
the
wbi
program
and
were
inexperienced
in
the
subject
content
were
selected
to
participate
in
the
second
phase
details
of
the
distribution
of
the
participants
for
the
second
phase
are
presented
in
table
iii
to
help
them
use
the
wbi
program
the
second
phase
began
by
giving
the
students
an
introduction
to
the
functionality
of
the
wbi
program
subsequently
all
of
the
participants
interacted
with
the
wbi
program
and
their
interactions
with
the
program
were
recorded
in
a
log
file
the
students
were
given
a
task
sheet
containing
various
exercises
related
to
the
content
of
the
wbi
program
the
purpose
of
doing
this
is
to
ensure
that
the
participants
browse
all
contents
within
the
wbi
program
they
were
informed
that
they
could
use
the
wbi
program
for
a
maximum
of
90
minutes
due
to
the
relatively
small
sample
size
a
within-subjects
design
was
selected
for
experiment
design
reips
2000
in
this
way
participants
were
free
to
choose
preferred
navigation
tools
and
display
options
by
themselves
so
that
how
cognitive
styles
influence
their
choices
could
be
examined

data
analysis
raw
experimental
data
were
in
the
form
of
web
access
logs
and
initially
went
through
a
preprocessing
phase
in
which
all
damaged
links
were
traced
and
removed
from
the
database
in
order
to
discover
the
relationships
between
students
cognitive
styles
and
their
learning
patterns
it
is
necessary
to
extract
the
potentially
useful
information
from
raw
data
the
rationale
of
selecting
useful
information
is
based
on
a
comprehensive
review
by
chen
and
macredie
2002
which
examined
the
effects
of
cognitive
styles
on
student
learning
in
addition
to
their
findings
the
characteristics
of
the
raw
data
and
web
site
structure
were
also
taken
into
account
to
extract
the
attributes
that
reveal
students
learning
patterns
in
wbi
in
total
there
are
eight
attributes
including
the
total
number
of
pages
each
student
browsed
the
total
number
of
visited
pages
respectively
describing
overviews
examples
detailed
descriptions
the
total
number
of
times
each
navigational
tool
was
used
including
main
menu
hierarchical
map
and
alphabetical
index
and
the
number
of
repeated
visits
the
students
made
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
measurement
of
these
eight
attributes
is
based
on
the
students
choices
in
other
words
this
study
emphasizes
on
students
preferred
learning
patterns
instead
of
the
best
learning
patterns
because
cognitive
style
is
not
a
measure
of
intelligence
or
ability
rose
1988
in
order
to
conduct
a
comprehensive
evaluation
the
students
learning
patterns
were
analyzed
using
traditional
statistical
and
data
mining
techniques
the
former
were
applied
to
determine
whether
cognitive
styles
had
significant
effects
on
students
learning
patterns
the
latter
used
both
clustering
and
classification
methods
in
terms
of
clustering
the
k-means
algorithm
was
employed
to
produce
groups
of
students
that
shared
similar
learning
patterns
and
subsequently
the
corresponding
human
factors
for
each
group
were
identified
as
far
as
classification
is
concerned
the
students
learning
patterns
were
analyzed
using
decision
trees
with

clustering
k-means
is
one
of
the
simplest
clustering
algorithms
for
grouping
objects
with
similar
features
in
k-means
the
number
k
of
clusters
is
fixed
before
the
algorithm
runs
the
algorithm
randomly
picks
k
cluster
centers
assigns
each
point
to
the
cluster
whose
mean
is
closest
in
a
euclidean
distance
sense
then
computes
the
mean
vectors
of
the
points
assigned
to
each
cluster
and
uses
these
as
new
centers
in
an
iterative
approach
hand
et
al
2001
in
detail
the
first
step
is
to
define
k
centroids
centers
one
for
each
cluster
another
parameter
called
seed
s
is
used
to
generate
the
random
numbers
for
the
assignment
of
the
initial
centroids
following
that
the
algorithm
takes
each
datapoint
and
associates
it
with
the
closest
centroid
the
next
step
starts
when
all
the
datapoints
are
assigned
to
clusters
it
is
the
recalculation
procedure
of
k
new
centroids
for
these
k
new
centroids
a
new
binding
has
to
be
done
between
the
same
dataset
points
and
the
closest
new
centroid
these
two
steps
are
alternated
until
a
stopping
criterion
is
met
that
is
when
there
is
no
further
change
in
the
assignment
of
the
datapoints
evgenia
et
al
2004
the
outcome
of
the
algorithm
reveals
the
centroid
or
means
vector
of
each
cluster
as
well
as
statistics
on
the
number
and
percentage
of
instances
assigned
to
different
clusters
thus
centroids
can
be
used
to
characterize
the
behavior
of
each
of
the
formed
clusters
one
of
the
challenging
issues
in
using
the
k-means
algorithm
for
data
clustering
is
that
one
needs
to
decide
a
suitable
number
of
clusters
k
in
advance
this
prerequisite
can
be
a
drawback
to
other
experiments
and
domains
but
not
for
this
particular
experiment
since
the
dataset
is
not
large
we
ran
the
algorithm
for
k
2
10
the
other
issue
is
that
k-means
is
sensitive
to
how
clusters
are
initially
assigned
this
can
be
overcome
by
trying
different
values
for
the
seed
number
s
and
evaluate
results
in
order
to
determine
which
combination
fits
the
data

another
evaluation
was
needed
to
compare
various
combinations
of
the
attributes
that
characterize
each
user
the
goals
of
these
evaluations
were
to
minimize
variability
within
clusters
and
maximize
variability
between
clusters
in
other
words
the
similarity
rules
will
apply
maximally
to
the
members
of
one
cluster
and
minimally
to
members
belonging
to
the
rest
of
the
clusters
more
specifically
the
evaluations
will
emphasize
how
similar
the
behavior
of
a
particular
user
is
to
user
of
the
same
cluster
and
how
different
the
behavior
of
users
in
that
clusters
from
the
behavior
of
users
of
all
other
clusters
the
results
of
the
evaluations
indicated
that
there
were
no
significant
differences
among
various
attribute
combinations

that
the
most
efficient

classification
among
data
mining
techniques
decision
tree
is
one
of
the
most
frequently
used
methods
for
classification
a
decision
tree
is
used
to
discover
rules
and
relationships
by
systematically
subdividing
the
information
contained
in

chou
1991
chen

2003
typically
a
decision
tree
algorithm
begins
with
the
entire
set
of
data
splits
the
data
into
two
or
more
subsets
based
on
the
values
of
one
or
more
attributes
and
then
repeatedly
splits
each
subset
into
finer
subsets
until
the
size
of
each
subset
reaches
an
appropriate
level
the
entire
modeling
process
can
be
represented
in
a
tree
structure
and
the
model
generated
can
be
summarized
as
a
set
of

in
tree-structured
representations
a
set
of
data
is
represented
by
a
node
and
the
entire
data
set
is
represented
as
a
root
node
when
a
split
is
made
several
child
nodes
which
correspond
to
partitioned
data
subsets
are
formed
if
a
node
is
not
to
be
split
any
further
it
is
called
a
leaf
otherwise
it
is
an
internal
node
in
this
study
we
deal
with
binary
trees
where
each
split
produces
exactly
two
child
nodes
some
popular

ii
an
error-based
pruning
method
is
used
to
simplify
the

and
replacing
them
with

the
classification
performance
of
the
decision

is
tested
by
analyzing
the
number

the
number
of

determines
whether

can
be
applied
to

no

there

possible
explanation
for

is
that

in

wildemuth

for
example
intermediate

of

are
almost

it
suggests
that
they
are
equally
comfortable
using
each

one
possible
interpretation
is
that
individuals
possessing
an
intermediate
cognitive

combine
the
characteristics
of
both
field
independence
and
field
dependence
and
employ
a
more
versatile

analytical
vs

a
major
issue
in
identifying
differences
between
field-independent
and
fielddependent
students
is
their
separate
tendencies
to
adopt
analytical
and
global
approaches
this
difference
may
explain
the
results
of
this
study
that
field-independent
students
tend
to
browse
fewer
pages
than
field-dependent
students
a
possible
interpretation
of
this
finding
is
that
field-independent
students
tend
to
be
more
analytical
ford
et
al
1994
and
they
are
very
task
oriented
witkin
et
al
1977
hence
they
only
pay
attention
to
particular
topics
related
to
their
learning
and
thus
browse
fewer

on
the
contrary
field-dependent
students

therefore
they

such
findings
strengthen
the
claim
of

research
that

are
good
at

active

field-dependent

field-independent

with
means
to
locate
particular
information
without
going
through
a
fixed

chen

this
may
be
due
to
the
fact
that
field-independent

actively
segment

the

this

but
they

therefore
there
is
a
lack
of
concrete
guidance
for
students
students
need
to
transfer
their
knowledge
into

this
may

implications
for
system
design
the
previous
discussion
suggests
that
student
learning
patterns
are
significantly
influenced
by
their
cognitive
styles
field-independent
and
fielddependent
learners
have
different
characteristics
that
affect
their
learning
patterns
this
implies
that
wbi
programs
should
be
developed
to
support
the
unique
needs
of
each
cognitive
style
group
more
specifically
the
wbi
programs
should
be
flexible
enough
to
offer
multiple
options
tailored
to
the
distinctive
cognitive
styles
to
this
end
a
model
figure

which
was
developed
using
the
results
presented
in
section

can
be
considered
as
a
mechanism
to
help
designers
develop
wbi
programs
that
can
accommodate
the
preferences
of
both
field-independent
and
field-dependent
learners
the
core
of
the

consists
of

the
results
of
our
study
have
shown
that
field-independent
students
are
capable
of
extracting
relevant
information
from
the
detailed
description
which
lacks
practical
instruction
because
they
have
a
tendency
to
use
their
own
internal
references
on
the
other
hand
field-dependent
students
rely
more
heavily
on
external
cues
thus
they
prefer
to
get
concrete
guidance
from

one
of
the
possible
ways
to
address
their
different

is
to
show
both

detailed

concrete

within

by
using

place

one

can
be
used
to
present
the
detailed
descriptions
of
a
particular

while
the
other
column
provides
the

for
that

this
approach
not
only
lets
field-independent

have
a
look
at

but
also
provides
field-dependent

field-independent
students
approach
an
environment
in
an
analytical
fashion
so
they
tend
to
focus
on
information
that
is
relevant
to
their
tasks
hence
they
browse
fewer
pages
to
directly
get
to
relevant
topics
for
completing
their
tasks
conversely
field-dependent
students
use
a
global
approach
to
process
information
so
they
tend
to
build
an
overall
picture
by
browsing
more
pages
one
of
the
potential
solutions
to
deal
with
their
different
requirements
is
to
use
a
pop-up
window
which
is
a
secondary
window
to
provide
additional
information
about
selected
objects

in
this

a
pop-up
window
can
be
used
to
show
additional
topics
for
field-dependent
students
who
would
like
to
get
a

however
these
windows
can
be
switched
off
lest
they
irritate
field-independent
students
who
have
a
tendency
to
focus
on
specific
relevant
topics
in
other
words
information
that
is
related
to
tasks
is
put
in

conclusions
wbi
creates
learning
opportunities
for
everyone
if
suitable
considerations
are
made
in
the
design
process
otherwise
they
can
impose
needless
barriers
to
equal
participation
in
educational
settings
the
experimental
results
obtained
in
this
study
suggest
that
cognitive
style
plays
an
influential
role
in
student
learning
patterns
within
wbi
field-independent
and
field-dependent
learners
have
different
preferences
for
locating
information
especially
for
the
selection
of
navigation
tools
and
display
options
thus
there
is
a
need
to
be
aware
of
cognitive
styles
when
planning
to
improve
the
usability
and
functionality
of
wbi
programs
the
contribution
of
this
study
includes
three
aspects
theory
methodology
and
applications
in
terms
of
theory
this
study
deepens
the
understanding
of
the
importance
of
cognitive
styles
in
the
development
of
wbi
programs
by
providing
empirical
evidence
cognitive
styles
gender
differences
and
system
experience
are
factors
that
are
frequently
considered
in
the
literature
of
individual
differences
but
it
is
inconclusive
as
to
their
relative
importance
the
findings
of
this
study
indicated
that
cognitive
style
is
a
major
factor
that
influences
student
learning
patterns
however
it
was
only
one
relatively
small
study
further
work
needs
to
be
undertaken
with
a
larger
sample
to
provide
additional
evidence
with
regard
to
methodology
this
study
analyzed
the
experimental
data
with
a
data
mining
approach
which
used
both
clustering
and
classification
techniques
these
two
techniques
are
complementary
in
that
they
integrate
the
analysis
of
macro
and
micro
levels
the
results
from
clustering
present
an
overall
picture
of
the
students
learning
patterns
whereas
those
from
classification
provide
the
detailed
rules
for
the
automatic
identification
of
students
cognitive
styles
based
on
their
learning
patterns
however
this
study
only
used
two
methods
that
is
k-means
clustering
and
decision
trees
classification
given
any
dataset
there
are
often
no
strict
rules
that
impose
the
use
of
a
specific
method
over
another
in
its
analysis
therefore
it
is
necessary
to
conduct
further
work
to
analyze
student
learning
patterns
using
other
clustering
or
classification
methods
for
examples
self-organizing
maps
and
support
vector
machines
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
whether
similar
results
can
be
found
by
using
these
methods
as
far
as
the
application
is
concerned
this
study
recognized
the
importance
of
versatility
in
the
development
of
wbi
programs
and
developed
a
model
to
illustrate
the
needs
of
different
cognitive
styles
in
addition
several
design
approaches
were
proposed
to
accommodate
the
preferences
of
both
fieldindependent
and
field-dependent
learners
in
the
future
the
rationale
of
the
model
and
the
design
approaches
can
be
used
to
improve
the
development
of
existing
wbi
programs
and
other
web-based
applications
such
as
digital
libraries
search
engines
and
electronic
journals
finally
it
would
be
valuable
to
see
whether
such
wbi
programs
and
the
web-based
applications
can
promote
learners
performance
and
increase
their
satisfaction
