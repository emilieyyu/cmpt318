a
formal

this
article
is
a
study
of
the
themes
and
issues
concerning
the
annotation
of
digital
contents
such
as
textual
documents
images
and
multimedia
documents
in
general
these
digital
contents
are
automatically
managed
by
different
kinds
of
digital
library
management
systems
and
more
generally
by
different
kinds
of
information
management
systems
even
though
this
topic
has
already
been
partially
studied
by
other
researchers
the
previous
research
work
on
annotations
has
left
many
open
issues
these
issues
concern
the
lack
of
clarity
about
what
an
annotation
is
what
its
features
are
and
how
it
is
used
these
issues
are
mainly
due
to
the
fact
that
models
and
systems
for
annotations
have
only
been
developed
for
specific
purposes
as
a
result
there
is
only
a
fragmentary
picture
of
the
annotation
and
its
management
and
this
is
tied
to
specific
contexts
of
use
and
lacks-general
validity
the
aim
of
the
article
is
to
provide
a
unified
and
integrated
picture
of
the
annotation
ranging
from
defining
what
an
annotation
is
to
providing
a
formal
model
the
key
ideas
of
the
model
are
the
distinction
between
the
meaning
and
the
sign
of
the
annotation
which
represent
the
semantics
and
the
materialization
of
an
annotation
respectively
the
clear
formalization
of
the
temporal
dimension
involved
with
annotations
and
the
introduction
of
a
distributed
hypertext
between
digital
contents
and
annotations
therefore
the
proposed
formal
model
captures
both
syntactic
and
semantic
aspects
of
the
annotations
furthermore
it
is
built
on
previously
existing
models
and
may
be
seen
as
an
extension
of
them

introduction
digital
library
management
systems
dlms
are
currently
in
a
state
of
evolution
today
they
are
simply
places
where
information
resources
can
be
stored
and
made
available
to
end
users
whereas
tomorrow
they
will
increasingly
become
an
integrated
part
of
the
way
the
user
works
for
example
instead
of
simply
downloading
a
paper
and
then
working
on
a
printed
version
a
user
will
be
able
to
work
directly
with
the
paper
by
means
of
the
tools
provided
by
the
dlms
and
share
their
work
with
colleagues
by
doing
this
the
user
s
intellectual
work
and
the
information
resources
provided
by
the
dlms
can
be
merged
to
form
a
single
working
context
the
dlms
therefore
is
no
longer
perceived
as
something
external
to
the
intellectual
production
process
nor
is
it
seen
as
a
mere
consulting
tool
instead
it
becomes
an
intrinsic
and
active
part
of
the
intellectual
production
process
as
pointed
out
in
agosti
and
ferro
2005a
and
candela
et
al
2006
this
turning
point
in
dlms
also
clearly
emerges
from
the
outcomes
of
the
third
brainstorming
meeting
organized
by
delos1
the
european
network
of
excellence
on
digital
libraries
funded
by
the
eu
s
6th
framework
programme
the
main
conclusions
were
the
following
first
digital
libraries
need
to
become
more
user-centered
second
digital
libraries
should
not
simply
be
passive
repositories
rather
they
should
provide
users
with
tools
for
more
active
cooperation
and
communication
and
third
there
is
an
increasing
need
for
generalized
digital
library
management
systems
delos
2004
annotations
are
an
effective
means
to
enable
the
interaction
between
users
and
the
dlms
we
envision
since
their
use
is
a
diffuse
and
very
well-established
practice
annotations
are
not
only
a
way
of
explaining
and
enriching
an
information
resource
with
personal
observations
but
also
a
means
of
transmitting
and
sharing
ideas
to
improve
collaborative
work
practices
furthermore
annotations
allow
users
to
naturally
merge
and
link
personal
contents
with
the
information
resources
provided
by
the
dlms
so
that
a
common
context
unifying
all
of
these
contents
can
be
created
furthermore
annotations
cover
a
very
broad
spectrum
because
they
range
from
explaining
and
enriching
an
information
resource
with
personal
observations
to
transmitting
and
sharing
ideas
and
knowledge
on
a
subject
therefore
annotations
can
be
geared
not
only
to
the
individual
s
way
of
working
and
to
a
given
method
of
study
but
also
to
a
way
of
doing
research
moreover
they
may
cover
different
scopes
and
have
different
kinds
of
annotative
context
they
can
be
private
shared
or
public
according
to
the
type
of
intellectual
work
that
is
being
carried
out
in
addition
the
boundaries
among
these
scopes
are
not
fixed
rather
they
may
vary
and
evolve
with
time
finally
annotations
call
for
active
involvement
the
degree
of
which
varies
according
to
the
aim
of
the
annotation
private
annotations
require
the
involvement
of
the
authors
whereas
shared
or
public
annotations
involve
the
participation
of
a
whole
community
therefore
annotations
are
suitable
for
improving
collaboration
and
cooperation
among
users
as
pointed
out
by
ioannidis
et
al
2005
this
turning
point
of
digital
library
dl
requires
that
dl
development
must
move
from
an
art
to
a
science
and
it
needs
unifying
and
comprehensive
theories
and
frameworks
across
the
lifecycle
of
dl
information
ioannidis
et
al

p

the
streams
structures

societies
5s
model
proposed
by
goncalves
et
al
2004a
is
an
example
of
such
a
framework
and
was
one
of
the
first
efforts
in
this
direction
more
recently
the
reference
model
for
dlms
agosti
et
al
2006a
aims
at
laying
the
foundations
and
identifying
the
cornerstone
concepts
within
the
universe
of
digital
libraries
thus
facilitating
the
integration
of
research
and
proposing
better
ways
of
developing
appropriate
systems
the
notion
of
annotation
has
been
explicitly
introduced
in
this
model
as
a
first
class
concept
for
the
universe
of
dls
the
aim
of
this
article
is
to
contribute
to
the
development
of
such
unifying
frameworks
by
proposing
a
formal
model
for
the
annotation
of
digital
contents
the
motivations
of
this
proposal
lie
in
the
previous
presentation
dls
are
moving
towards
more
mature
dlms
which
are
supported
by
well
defined
formal
frameworks
and
annotations
are
also
headed
in
that
broad
direction
furthermore
to
date
there
has
been
little
agreement
about
what
an
annotation
is
nor
has
a
comprehensive
and
formal
model
of
the
annotation
been
proposed
with
respect
to
this
last
point
buneman
et
al
2002
p
150
state
that
view
annotation2
is
becoming
an
increasingly
useful
method
of
communicating
meta-data
among
users
of
shared
scientific
data
sets
and
to
our
knowledge
there
has
been
no
formal
study
of
this
problem
and
bottoni
et
al
2003
p
216
point
out
that
strangely
enough
there
is
not
an
agreement
yet
on
the
definition
of
digital
annotation
or
on
how
to
distinguish
it
from
other
digital
entities
e
g
hyperlinks
metadata
newsgroup
messages
furthermore
an
analysis
of
the
basic
operations
to
be
enabled
by
a
digital
annotation
system
seems
to
be
lacking
the
aim
of
the
formal
model
we
propose
is
to
formalize
the
main
concepts
concerning
annotations
and
to
define
the
relationships
between
annotations
and
annotated
information
resources
therefore
the
proposed
formal
model
captures
both
syntactic
and
semantic
aspects
of
the
annotations
as
well
as
building
on
previously
existing
models
such
as
the
streams
structures
spaces
scenarios
societies
model
this
new
model
thus
becomes
as
compatible
as
possible
with
the
previous
ones
and
may
be
seen
as
an
extension
of
them
the
rest
of
this
article
is
organized
as
follows

an
overview
of

the
aim
of
this
section
is
to
introduce
the
two
main
approaches
that
have
been
adopted
for
dealing
with
annotations
we
can
consider
them
either
metadata
which
is
discussed
in
section
2
1
or
content
which
is
presented
in
section
2
2
this
broad
distinction
in
the
viewpoints
about
annotations
is
also
pointed
out
by
marshall
1998
when
she
distinguishes
between
formal
versus
informal
annotations
where
the
former
are
metadata
and
the
latter
are
marginalia
of
the
sort
that
we
write
to
ourselves
as
we
read
a
journal
article
marshall
1998
p
41
which
correspond
to
the
content
this
section
does
not
aim
at
providing
a
full
and
exhaustive
survey
of
all
the
systems
offering
annotation
capabilities
that
have
been
developed
so
far
for
this
please
refer
to
agosti
et
al
2007a
handschuh
and
staab
2003
and
nagao
2003
instead
the
goal
here
is
to
describe
some
relevant
uses
and
features
of
annotations
so
that
in
section
3
these
features
can
be
used
to
gain
some
insights
which
will
prove
useful
when
developing
a
formal
model
for
annotations
2
1
annotations
as
metadata
annotations
can
be
considered
metadata
that
is
additional
data
which
relate
to
an
existing
content
and
clarify
the
properties
annotated
content
with
this
aim
in
mind
annotations
have
to
conform
to
some
specifications
that
define
the
structure
the
semantics
the
syntax
and
even
the
values
that
annotations
can
assume
the
recipients
of
this
kind
of
annotation
are
both
people
and
computing
devices
on
the
one
hand
metadata
can
benefit
people
because
if
they
are
expressed
in
a
human-readable
form
and
their
format
and
fields
are
known
they
can
be
read
by
people
and
used
to
obtain
useful
and
well-structured
information
about
an
existing
content
on
the
other
hand
metadata
offer
computing
devices
the
means
for
automatically
processing
the
annotated
contents
consider
for
example
the
case
of
the
machine
readable
cataloging
marc
3
records
not
only
they
are
a
useful
information
source
for
the
users
of
online
public
access
catalogs
opac
which
often
make
marc
records
accessible
but
they
also
act
as
a
standard
for
the
representation
and
communication
of
bibliographic
and
related
information
in
machinereadable
form
and
hence
for
the
automatic
processing
of
this
information
by
computing
devices
note
that
the
examples
presented
below
have
the
dual
use
just
described
they
can
be
considered
useful
for
both
people
and
computing
devices
a
relevant
example
of
this
use
of
annotations
is
the
mpeg-7
standard
formally
named
multimedia
content
description
interface
which
is
a
standard
for
annotating
and
describing
multimedia
content
data
iso
2004
to
a
certain
degree
mpeg-7
supports
the
interpretation
of
the
information
meaning
which
can
be
passed
onto
or
accessed
by
a
device
or
a
computer
code
mpeg-7
is
not
aimed
at
any
application
in
particular
rather
the
elements
that
mpeg-7
standardizes
can
support
many
broad
ranges
of
applications
in
this
case
annotating
a
multimedia
document
means
filling
in
the
various
fields
provided
by
the
mpeg-7
standard
in
order
to
describe
the
features
of
the
object
at
hand
similar
uses
of
annotations
can
be
found
in
the
natural
language
processing
field
for
example
part
of
speech
tagging
consists
of
annotating
each
word
in
a
sentence
with
a
tag
that
describes
its
appropriate
part
of
speech
so
as
to
decide
whether
a
word
is
a
noun
a
verb
an
adjective
and
so
on
jurafsky
and
martin
2000
manning
and
schutze
2001
in
both
cases
annotations
are
usually
embedded
in
the
annotated
digital
objects
a
broader
example
of
the
use
of
annotations
as
metadata
is
provided
by
the
semantic
web
w3c
2007
initiative
promoted
by
the
world
wide
web
consortium
w3c
which
aims
at
enhancing
human-understandable
data
namely
web
pages
with
computer-understandable
data
namely
metadata
so
that
information
is
given
well-defined
meaning
better
enabling
computing
devices
and
people
to
work
in
cooperation
berners-lee
et
al
2001
the
process
of
adding
metadata
to
web
pages
is
called
semantic
annotation
because
it
involves
the
decoration
of
existing
data
such
as
a
piece
of
text
whose
content
is
understandable
only
to
people
with
semantic
metadata
that
describe
that
piece
of
text
so
that
computers
can
process
it
and
thus
in
turn
offer
automation
integration
and
reuse
of
data
across
various
applications
handschuh
and
staab
2003
the
semantic

makes
use
of

as
a
syntax
for
describing
and
exchanging
metadata
in
this
context
the
annotea
project
developed
by
the
w3c
kahan
and
koivunen
2001
w3c
2005a
sees
annotations
as
metadata
and
interprets
them
as
the
first
step
in
creating
an
infrastructure
for
handling
and
associating
metadata
with
content
thus
leading
to
the
semantic
web
annotea
predefines
annotation
types
from
a
list
that
contains
some
of
the
following
comments
notes
explanations
or
other
types
of
external
remarks
that
can
be
attached
to
any
web
document
or
a
selected
part
of
the
document
without
modifying
the
document
annotea
uses
rdf
and
extensible
markup
language
xml
5
for
describing
annotations
as
metadata
and
xpointer6
for
locating
the
annotations
in
the
annotated
document
annotea
employs
a
client-server
architecture
where
annotations
reside
in
dedicated
servers
and
a
specialized
browser
is
capable
of
retrieving
them
upon
request
when
visiting
a
web
page

one
step
further
and

research
on
illuminated
manuscripts
is
the
unveiling
of
hidden
connections
among
illustrations
belonging
to
different
manuscripts
the
use
of
annotations
has
been
proposed
as
a
useful
way
of
accessing
a
digital
archive
and
sharing
knowledge
in
a
cooperative
environment
in
ipsa
annotations
are
links
that
connect
one
image
to
another
image
related
to
it
because
illustrations
were
copied
from
images
in
other
manuscripts
or
they
were
merely
inspired
by
previous
works
or
they
were
directly
inspired
by
nature
ipsa
utilizes
annotations
as
metadata
because
they
are
drawn
from
a
link
taxonomy
which
comprises
two
broad
classes
the
first
deals
with
hierarchical
relationships
between
two
images
where
one
image
somehow
depends
on
an
earlier
one
the
second
concerns
relatedness
relationships
between
two
images
where
they
both
share
similar
properties
even
though
they
were
created
independently
both
classes
contain
more
specialized
annotation/link
types
ipsa
manages
and
stores
annotations
in
the
same
archive
where
the
illuminated
manuscripts
are
stored
even
if
annotations
are
separated
from
the
annotated
digital
objects
and
they
do
not
modify
them
finally
rigaux
and
spyratos
2004
and
gueye
et
al
2004
propose
a
data
model
for
the
composition
and
metadata
management
of
documents
in
a
distributed
setting
such
as
a
dlms
the
model
enables
the
creation
of
composite
documents
which
are
made
up
of
either
composite
documents
or
atomic
documents
which
can
be
any
piece
of
uniquely
identifiable
material
a
set
of
annotations
is
associated
to
each
composite
document
where
they
interpret
annotations
as
terms
taken
from
a
controlled
vocabulary
or
taxonomy
to
which
all
authors
adhere
the
model
provides
algorithms
to
automatically
compute
the
annotations
of
composite
documents
starting
from
the
annotations
of
its
composing
atomic
documents
by
means
of
a
subsumption
relation
defined
within
the
taxonomy
mentioned
previously
annotations
are
also
used
in
the
context
of
database
management
systems
dbms
and
in
particular
in
the
case
of
curated
databases
and
scientific
databases
swiss-prot10
is
a
curated
protein
sequence
database
which
strives
to
provide
a
high
level
of
annotation
such
as
the
description
of
the
function
of
a
protein
its
domain
structure
and
so
on
in
this
case
the
annotations
are
embedded
in
the
database
and
merged
with
the
annotated
content
biodas11
provides
a
distributed
annotation
system
which
is
a
system
based
on
web
servers
for
sharing
lists
of
annotations
across
a
certain
segment
of
the
genome
in
this
case
annotations
are
not
mixed
together
with
the
content
they
annotate
they
are
instead
separated
from
it
annotations
have
types
methods
and
categories
the
annotation
type
is
selected
from
a
list
of
types
that
have
biological
significance
the
annotation
method
is
intended
to
describe
how
the
annotated
feature
was
discovered
and
may
include
a
reference
to
a
program
the
annotation
category
is
a
broad
functional
category
that
can
be
used
to
filter
group
and
sort
annotations
stein
et
al
2002
buneman
et
al
2001
2002
investigate
the
use
of
annotations
with
respect
to
the
data
provenance
problem
sometimes
also
referred
to
as
data
lineage
or
data
pedigree
data
provenance
which
is
the
description
of
the
origins
of
a
piece
of
data
and
the
process
by
which
it
arrived
in
a
database
is
undoubtedly
an
open
and
challenging
research
issue
in
the
field
of
dbms
as
abiteboul
et
al
2005
point
out
buneman
et
al
2001
distinguish
between
why-provenance
which
explains
why
a
given
piece
of
data
is
in
the
database
and
where-provenance
which
explains
where
a
given
piece
of
data
comes
from
the
distinguishing
feature
of
scientific
databases
is
that
data
needs
to
be
tracked
for
example
to
know
which
instruments
were
used
to
gather
the
data
and
what
their
settings
were
moreover
scientists
and
experts
continuously
correct
and
annotate
the
original
source
data
and
this
too
is
a
way
of
carrying
out
their
research
work
bhagwat
et
al
2004
carry
on
the
research
into
provenance
and
propose
an
extension
to
a
relational
dbms
and
to
structured
query
language
sql
called
propagate
sql
which
provides
a
clause
for
propagating
annotations
to
tuples
through
queries
they
see
annotations
as
information
about
data
such
as
provenance
comments
or
other
types
of
metadata
they
envisage
the
following
applications
of
annotations
in
dbms
tracing
the
provenance
and
flow
of
data
reporting
errors
or
remarks
about
a
piece
of
data
and
describing
the
quality
or
the
security
level
of
a
piece
of
data
as
a
final
example
of
the
use
of
annotations
as
metadata
once
more
in
the
context
of
scientific
databases
buneman
et
al
2004
propose
an
archiving
technique
for
managing
and
archiving
different
versions
of
scientific
databases
over
time
they
exploit
the
hierarchical
structure
of
scientific
data
to
represent
the
content
and
the
different
versions
of
the
database
with
a
tree
structure
they
attach
annotations
to
the
nodes
of
the
tree
annotations
that
contain
time-stamp
and
key
information
about
the
underlying
data
structure
therefore
these
annotations
are
metadata
about
the
annotations
contained
in
the
database
itself
in
a
sense
we
could
say
that
these
annotations
are
meta-metadata
as
we
can
see
they
differ
from
the
annotations
contained
in
the
database
in
that
they
are
metadata
about
the
modifications
to
the
contents
of
the
database
over
time
while
the
latter
are
metadata
about
genome
sequences
on
the
whole
this
annotated
tree
structure
provides
an
additional
data
layer
that
enables
the
development
of
efficient
algorithms
for
archiving
and
searching
for
the
different
versions
of
the
database

annotations
as
content
annotations
are
regarded
as
additional
content
that
relates
to
an
existing
content
meaning
that
they
increase
the
existing
content
by
providing
an
additional
layer
of
elucidation
and
explanation
however
this
elucidation
does
not
happen
as
in
the
case
of
annotations
as
metadata
by
means
of
some
kind
of
constrained
or
formal
description
of
the
semantics
of
the
annotated
object
on
the
contrary
the
explanation
itself
takes
the
shape
of
an
additional
content
that
can
help
people
understand
the
annotated
content
however
the
semantics
of
the
additional
content
may
be
no
more
explicit
for
a
computing
device
than
the
semantics
of
the
annotated
content
this
view
of
annotations
is
comparable
to
the
activity
of
reading
a
document
and
adding
notes
to
it
explanation
and
clarification
of
words
or
passages
of
the
document
by
expounding
on
it
providing
a
commentary
on
it
and
finally
completing
it
with
personal
observations
and
ideas
therefore
the
final
recipients
of
this
kind
of
annotation
are
people
because
a
content
annotation
does
not
make
the
annotated
object
more
readily
processable
by
a
computer
than
the
same
object
without
annotations
in
fact
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
computer
the
semantics
of
content
annotations
needs
to
be
in
some
way
processed
for
example
indexed
before
it
can
be
used
to
deal
with
the
semantics
of
the
annotated
object
this
is
quite
different
from
the
case
of
metadata
annotations
which
are
pieces
of
information
ready
to
be
used
for
interpreting
the
semantics
of
the
annotated
object
in
contrast
the
additional
semantics
provided
by
content
annotations
can
offer
people
useful
interpretations
and
comments
for
the
annotated
object
making
it
easier
to
understand
its
hidden
facets
this
view
of
annotations
entails
an
intrinsic
dualism
between
annotation
as
content
enrichment
and
annotation
as
stand-alone
document
the
former
considers
annotations
as
mere
additional
content
regarding
an
existing
document
and
as
a
result
they
are
not
autonomous
entities
but
in
fact
rely
on
previously
existing
information
resources
to
justify
their
existence
the
latter
regards
annotations
as
real
documents
and
autonomous
entities
that
maintain
some
sort
of
connection
with
an
existing
document
this
twofold
nature
of
the
annotation
can
be
made
clearer
by
considering
how
we
study
a
document
first
of
all
we
can
annotate
some
passages
that
require
a
further
looking
into
we
can
consider
this
as
a
sort
of
annotation
as
content
enrichment
second
we
can
reconsider
and
collect
our
annotations
and
we
can
use
them
as
a
starting
point
for
a
new
document
this
is
an
example
of
annotation
as
a
stand-alone
document
in
this
case
the
annotation
process
can
be
seen
as
an
informal
unstructured
elaboration
that
could
lead
to
a
rethinking
of
the
annotated
document
and
to
the
creation
of
a
new
one
note
that
both
kinds
of
content
annotation
are
valuable
and
the
boundaries
between
them
may
fade
into
one
another
with
the
passing
of
time
as
a
consequence
both
kinds
of
content
annotations
need
to
be
considered
as
first-class
digital
objects

moving
forward
in
the
context
of
the
web
the
conote
davis
and
huttenlocher
1995
is
a
cooperative
system
for
supporting
communications
within
groups
of
users
by
using
shared
annotations
on
a
set
of
documents
conote
offers
plain
text
or
hypertext
markup
language
html
w3c
1999
annotations
on
web
pages
and
pays
particular
attention
in
structuring
annotations
on
the
same
part
of
a
document
as
a
tree
in
order
to
ease
the
discussion
among
the
users
by
supporting
replies
to
previously
inserted
annotations
conote
stores
annotations
separately
from
the
original
web
page
and
displays
them
on
request
by
using
a
standard
browser
a
similar
approach
is
also
adopted
by
the
webann
system
brush
et
al
2002
which
is
aimed
at
supporting
interaction
between
students
and
instructors
by
using
annotations
with
respect
to
conote
it
offers
users
the
possibility
of
more
finely
tuned
annotations
a
recent
example
of
this
kind
of
annotation
system
in
the
web
is
multimedia
annotation
of
digital
content
over
the
web
madcow
bottoni
et
al
2004
2005b
this
system
enables
multimedia
annotation
on
web
pages
and
is
based
on
a
client-server
architecture
servers
are
repositories
of
annotations
to
which
different
clients
can
connect
while
the
client
is
a
plug-in
for
a
standard
web
browser
madcow
uses
hypertext
transfer
protocol
http
fielding
et
al
1999
as
the
communication
protocol
between
the
annotation
servers
and
the
browser
plugin
moreover
it
assumes
that
pages
are
written
in
html
in
order
to
annotate
web
pages
it
supports
both
private
and
public
annotations
and
allows
different
pre-established
types
of
annotations
such
as
explanation
comment
question
solution
summary
and
so
on
which
are
defined
according
to
the
rhetorical
structure
theory
rst
mann
and
thompson
1987
note
that
once
annotations
have
been
created
they
are
assigned
a
uniform
resource
locator
url
berners-lee
1994a
and
are
treated
as
any
other
html
document
therefore
annotations
can
be
made
on
other
annotations
annotations
as
content
also
find
a
natural
application
in
the
context
of
a
dl
a
dl
is
not
only
the
digital
version
of
traditional
libraries
and
archives
but
also
offers
instruments
and
services
that
can
go
beyond
the
mere
presentation
of
content
stored
in
digital
repositories
lesk
2005
witten
and
bainbridge
2003
candela
et
al
2006
annotations
can
be
considered
one
such
instrument
moreover
as
introduced
in
section
1
both
dls
and
their
management
systems
the
dlms
can
greatly
benefit
from
annotations
for
actively
involving
users
and
promoting
interaction
among
them
ioannidis
et
al
2005
also
agree
with
this
point
when
they
state
that
dlms
should
provide
the
means
for
creating
annotations
and
should
support
the
storage
selective
sharing
and
configurable
presentation
of
annotations
different
layers
of
annotations
can
coexist
for
the
same
document
a
private
layer
of
annotations
accessible
only
by
authors
of
the
annotations
a
collective
layer
of
annotations
shared
by
a
team
of
people
and
finally
a
public
layer
of
annotations
accessible
to
all
the
users
of
the
digital
library
in
this
way
user
communities
can
benefit
from
different
views
of
the
information
resources
managed
by
the
dl
marshall
1997
marshall
and
brush
2002
2004
a
dl
can
encourage
cooperative
work
practices
enabling
the
sharing
of
documents
and
annotations
also
with
the
aid
of
special
devices
such
as
xlibris
schilit
et
al
1998
finally
as
suggested
in
marshall
et
al
2001b
marshall
and
ruotolo
2002
searching
reading
and
annotating
the
information
resources
of
a
dl
can
be
done
together
with
other
activities
for
example
working
with
colleagues
this
may
also
occur
in
a
mobile
context
where
merging
content
and
wireless
communications
can
foster
ubiquitous
access
to
dlms
improving
well
established
cooperative
practices
of
work
and
exploiting
physical
and
digital
resources
the
wireless
context
and
the
small
form
factor
of
handheld
devices
challenge
our
technical
horizons
for
information
management
and
access
specialized
solutions
are
required
to
overcome
the
constraints
imposed
by
such
kinds
of
devices
as
reported
in
agosti
and
ferro
2003b
an
example
of
this
use
of
annotations
in
dlms
is
collaboratory
for
annotation
indexing
and
retrieval
of
digitized
historical
archive
material
collate
frommholz
et
al
2003
thiel
et
al
2004
which
supports
the
collaboration
among
film
scientists
and
archivists
who
are
annotating
historical
film
documentation
dealing
with
digitized
versions
of
documents
about
european
films
from
the
1920s
and
1930s
such
documents
are
censorship
documents
newspaper
articles
posters
advertisement
material
registration
cards
and
photos
annotations
support
user
communities
in
accessing
the
information
resources
provided
by
the
dl
in
a
personalized
and
customized
way
they
are
dialog
acts
part
of
a
discourse
about
film
documentation
and
constitute
the
document
context
intended
as
the
context
of
the
collaborative
discourse
in
which
the
document
is
placed
this
collaborative
discourse
is
carried
out
by
allowing
annotations
to
annotate
other
annotations
note
that
collate
offers
different
predefined
types
of
dialog
acts
such
as
elaboration
comparison
argumentation
counterargument
and
so
on
in
this
respect
collate
opts
for
a
solution
similar
to
the
one
adopted
by

is
a
flexible
system
designed
to
support
two
different
things
various
architectural
paradigms
such
as
peer-topeer
p2p
or
web

ws
architectures
a
wide
range
of
different
dlms
the
flexibility
of
fast
and
its
independence
from
any
particular
dlms
is
a
key
feature
for
providing
users
with
a
uniform
means
of
interaction
with
annotation
functionalities
without
the
need
for
changing
their
annotative
practices
only
because
a
user
works
with
different
dlms
fast
supports
both
users
and
groups
of
users
with
different
access
permission
on
annotations
and
offers
three
different
scopes
for
the
annotations
private
shared
and
public
furthermore
annotations
in
fast
allow
users
to
merge
their
personal
content
with
the
information
resources
managed
by
diverse
dlms
annotations
can
span
and
cross
the
boundaries
of
a
single
dlms
annotating
digital
objects
that
are
part
of
different
dls
if
users
so
desire
finally
this
use
of
annotations
gives
the
users
the
possibility
of
linking
digital
objects
that
otherwise
would
have
remained
separated
because
they
were
managed
by
different
dlms
ioannidis
et
al
2005
recently
noted
this
as
an
advantage
for
users
and
a
challenge
for
the
next
generation
dlms
fast
also
constitutes
the
underlying
infrastructure
of
the
digital
library
annotation
service
dilas

agosti
et

2006b
which
is
an
ongoing
project
in
the
framework
of
delos
the
european
network
of
excellence
on
digital
libraries
the
goal
of
dilas
is
to
design
and
develop
a
generic
annotation
service
that
can
be
easily
used
in
different
dlms
dilas
aims
at
defining
a
set
of
application
program
interfaces
to
enable
both
access
to
this
service
from
different
dlms
and
the
creation
of
different
annotation
clients
and
user
interfaces
embedded
in
various
dlms
the
annotation
service
will
be
evaluated
as
a
new

table

summarizes
the
discussion
introduced
in
section
2
and
presents
systems
along
two
dimensions
one
is
the
degree
of
structure
of
the
content
and
the
other
is
the
degree
of
structure
of
the
annotation
the
structure
of
the
content
can
range
from
loosely
structured
documents
as
in
the
case
of
the
web
to
highly
structured
data
as
in
the
case
of
a
database
similarly
the
structure
of
the
annotation
can
vary
from
unstructured
or
loosely
structured
annotations
as
in
the
case
of
content
annotations
to
very
structured
annotations
as
in
the
case
of
metadata
annotations
note
that
we
have
put
the
notecards
system
under
the
web
box
even
though
it
was
developed
before
the
web
because
a
hypermedia
system
is
much
more
closer
to
the
web
than
to
dbms
or
dlms
we
can
point
out
that
across
the
different
systems
there
is
a
very
wide
range
of
uses
of
annotations
as
a
powerful
tool
for
uncovering
and
clarifying
the
semantics
of
the
annotated
objects
the
final
recipients
of
annotations
can
be
computing
devices
or
people
the
former
is
mainly
the
case
of
metadata
annotations
which
allow
annotated
objects
to
be
automatically
processed
integrated
and
reused
in
different
applications
even
though
these
metadata
annotations
can
be
understandable
and
useful
for
people
too
the
latter
is
mainly
the
case
of
content
annotations
which
elucidate
and
expound
on
an
annotated
object
note
that
also
in
this
latter
case
a
computing
device
can
become
the
recipient
of
such
annotations
provided
that
some
further
step
of
processing
is
performed
for
example
indexing
however
in
both
cases
the
semantics
of
the
annotation
itself
needs
to
be
taken
into
consideration
and
modeled
this
can
happen
formally
and
precisely
by
agreeing
on
metadata
standards
that
describe
how
annotations
should
to
be
interpreted
and
used
alternatively
support
can
be
provided
for
identifying
different
predefined
annotation
types
perhaps
with
varying
levels
of
detail
the
medium
of
the
annotation
can
vary
a
lot
it
can
range
from
textual
annotations
to
image
audio
and
video
annotations
in
a
general
setting
we
may
need
to
deal
with
multimedia
rich
annotations
composed
of
different
parts
each
with
its
own
medium
all
of
these
different
kinds
of
media
have
to
be
considered
and
properly
modeled
in
a
uniform
way
where
possible
both
annotations
and
annotated
objects
need
to
be
uniquely
identified
moreover
annotations
comprise
a
temporal
dimension
that
is
often
not
explicit
but
which
limits
the
creation
of
the
annotation
to
the
existence
of
another
object
this
temporal
relationship
between
the
annotation
and
the
annotated
object
does
not
mean
that
the
annotation
cannot
be
considered
a
stand-alone
intellectual
work
but
it
does
impose
a
temporal
ordering
between
the
existence
of
an
annotated
object
and
the
annotation
annotating
it
which
cannot
be
overlooked
in
addition
once
we
have
identified
both
the
annotation
and
the
annotated
object
we
need
to
link
and
anchor
the
annotation
to
the
part
of
the
annotated
object
in
question
this
can
happen
in
a
way
that
mainly
depends
on
the
medium
of
the
annotated
object
on
the
whole
we
need
to
model
how
annotations
and
annotated
objects
are
uniquely
identified
and
linked
together
maybe
with
a
varying
degree
of
granularity
in
the
anchoring
paying
particular
attention
to
the
temporal
dimension
that
regulates
the
relationships
between
annotations
and
annotated
objects
as
far
as
co
operation
is
concerned
almost
all
of
the
analyzed
systems
show
that
annotations
have
great
potential
for
supporting
and
improving
interaction
among
users
and
even
among
computing
devices
therefore
there
is
a
need
for
modeling
and
offering
different
scopes
of
annotations
for
example
private
shared
or
public
and
managing
the
access
rights
of
various
groups
of
users
finally
a
relevant
aspect
of
annotations
is
that
they
can
take
the
part
of
a
hypertext
agosti
et
al
2004
halasz
1988
marshall
1998
since
they
enable
the
creation
of
new
relationships
among
existing
objects
by
means
of
links
that
connect
annotations
together
with
existing
objects
as
we
will
see
later
in
more
detail
the
hypertext
viewpoint
about
annotations
is
common
to
different
systems
such
as
annotea
madcow
and
notecards
in
the
hypermedia/web
context
or
dilas
fast
and
ipsa
in
the
dlms
context
halasz
1988
points
out
that
annotations
are
one
of
the
activities
that
form
the
basis
of
any
collaborative
effort
and
for
which
hypermedia
systems
are
ideally
suited
while
marshall
1998
considers
annotations
a
natural
way
of
creating
and
growing
hypertexts
that
connect
information
resources
by
actively
engaging
users
in
addition
the
hypertext
between
annotations
and
annotated
objects
can
be
exploited
not
only
for
providing
alternative
navigation
and
browsing
capabilities
but
also
for
offering
advanced
search
functionalities
able
to
retrieve
more
and
better
ranked
objects
in
response
to
a
user
query
and
also
by
exploiting
the
annotations
linked
to
them
agosti
and
ferro
2005b
moreover
dlms
usually
offer
some
basic
hypertext
and
browsing
capabilities
based
on
the
available
structured
data
such
as
authors
or
references
on
the
other
hand
dlms
do
not
normally
provide
users
with
advanced
hypertext
functionalities
where
the
information
resources
are
linked
on
the
basis
of
the
semantics
of
their
content
and
hypertext
information
retrieval
hir
functionalities
are
available
as
in
agosti
et
al
1991
therefore
annotations
can
turn
out
to
be
an
effective
way
of
associating
this
kind
of
hypertext
to
a
dlms
to
enable
the
active
and
dynamic
use
of
information
resources
in
addition
this
hypertext
can
span
and
cross
the
boundaries
of
the
single
dlms
if
users
need
to
interact
with
the
information
resources
managed
by
diverse
dlms
agosti
and
ferro
2004
2005a
this
latter
possibility
is
quite
innovative
because
it
offers
the
means
for
interconnecting
various
dlms
in
a
personalized
and
meaningful
way
for
the
end-user
and
as
ioannidis
et
al
2005
point
out
this
is
a
major
challenge
for
the
next
generation
dlms
in
conclusion
this
hypertext
has
to
be
explicitly
modeled
and
taken
into
consideration
when
dealing
with
annotations
3

modeling
approach
the
previous
discussion
clearly
demonstrates
that
annotation
is
quite
a
complex
concept
comprising
a
number
of
different
aspects
therefore
when
we
attempt
to
model
annotations
we
have
to
work
through
this
complexity
first
to
identify
the
main
macro-areas
of
this
concept
and
second
to
provide
clear
definitions
of
the
concepts
within
each
macro-area
and
of
the
relationships
among
these
concepts
figure
1
provides
both
an
overview
of
the
areas
covered
and
the
detail
of
the
definitions
introduced
within
each
area
the
figure
clearly
shows
how
these
areas
correspond
to
the
very
basic
issues
that
emerge
when
we
think
about
annotations
we
need
to
identify
annotations
and
annotated
objects
in
order
to
link
them
together
perhaps
providing
facilities
for
supporting
cooperation
and
we
have
to
deal
with
both
the
actual
contents
of
an
annotation
and
the
semantics
expressed
by
those
contents
therefore
the
objective
of
the
formal
model
is
to
delimit
the
boundaries
of
each
area
and
to
clearly
define
the
concepts
contained
in
each
area
together
with
the
relationships
among
them
we
can
then
exploit
these
definitions
to
provide
a
comprehensive
definition
of
annotation
and
to
derive
from
this
definition
the
notion
of
hypertext
between
annotated
objects
and
annotations
to
this
end
we
adopt
a
modeling
approach
based
on
set
theory
halmos
1974
and
graph
theory
bollobas
1998
diestel
2000
in
the
remainder
of
this
section
we
will
briefly
introduce
the
areas
shown
in
figure
1
which
can
be
used
as
a
map
of
the
concepts
dealt
with
in
the
formal
model
note
that
figure
1
illustrates
the
main
areas
from
bottom
to
top
in
the
same
order
in
which
they
were
discussed
in
section
3
1
which
represents
the
natural
way
in
which
they
occur
when
we
reason
about
annotations
in
contrast
the
areas
are
presented
below
in
the
order
in
which
they
will
be
discussed
in
detail
in
sections
4
to
8
this
order
derives
from
the
need
to
introduce
concepts
and
definitions
in
a
linear
fashion
thus
avoiding
back
and
forth
references
between
them
finally
section
9
will
define
the
annotation
itself
and
section
10
will
discuss
the
hypertext
between
annotated
objects
and
annotations
which
can
also
be
thought
of
as
a
kind
of
a
concise
view
of
the
main
relationships
between
annotations
and
annotated
objects
identification
is
the
problem
of
uniquely
identifying
both
the
annotation
and
the
annotated
objects
highlighting
the
temporal
constraints
between
them
this
area
is
built
around
the
concept
of
handle
which
is
defined
as
a
unique
identifier
of
both
digital
objects
and
annotations
and
the
proposed
notation
for
dealing
with
the
time
dimension
involved
by
annotations
cooperation
is
about
annotations
as
a
cooperation
tool
among
users
it
introduces
the
definitions
of
user
and
group
of
users
together
with
the
associated
concept
of
scope
of
annotation
and
access
permission
which
regulate
the
access
policies
for
a
given
annotation
linking
deals
with
the
allowed
linking
patterns
between
digital
objects
and
annotations
and
the
problem
of
correctly
anchoring
annotations
to
digital
objects
it
defines
the
concepts
of
link
type
which
is
defined
as
the
allowed
methods
of
linking
annotations
to
annotated
objects
stream
which
abstracts
the
notion
of
content
of
a
digital
object
and
segment
which
represents
a
given
portion
of
a
stream
useful
for
anchoring
an
annotation
to
a
digital
object
semantics
concerns
the
meaning
of
the
annotation
and
what
it
stands
for
trying
to
make
explicit
the
semantics
of
the
different
parts
of
the
content
of
an
annotation
it
introduces
the
notions
of
meaning
of
annotation
which
is
part
of
the
semantics
of
the
whole
annotation
and
meanings
graph
that
is
a
graph
allows
for
interoperability
between
the
different
meanings
materialization
deals
with
the
way
in
which
the
semantics
carried
by
an
annotation
can
take
shape
that
is
the
actual
content
of
the
annotation
perceived
by
the
user
it
describes
the
sign
of
annotation
which
is
a
particular
type
of
stream
representing
part
of
the
content
of
an
annotation
the
proposed
formal
model
was
first
introduced
in
ferro
2004
and
a
reduced
version
of
it
was
adapted
to
the
context
of
illuminated
manuscripts
in
agosti
et

2006c

identification
in
order
to
uniquely
identify
both
the
annotation
and
the
annotated
objects
we
need
to
proceed
as
follows
first
we
need
to
define
the
objects
we
deal
with
as
described
in
section
4
1
then
we
also
have
to
be
able
to
deal
with
objects
whose
relationships
are
constrained
by
a
temporal
dimension
as
explained
in
section
4

finally
a
suitable
identification
mechanism
has
to
be
provided
as
introduced
in
section

document
annotation
and
digital
object
sets
according
to
widely
accepted
terminology
we
adopt
the
term
digital
object
to
refer
to
information
resources
managed
by
an
information
management
system
ims
indeed
paskin
2006
p

defines
the
digital
object
as
a
data
structure
whose
principal
components
are
digital
material
or
data
plus
a
unique
identifier
for
this
material
goncalves
et
al
2004a
p
292
say
that
information
in
digital
libraries
is
manifest
in
terms
of
digital
objects
which
can
contain
textual
or
multimedia
content
e
g
images
audio
video
and
metadata
and
they
define
a
digital
object
as
a
tuple
constituted
by
a
unique
handle
structured
contents
and
structural
metadata
goncalves
et
al
2004a
p
294
finally
bottoni
et
al
2003
p
217
define
the
digital
object
as
a
typed
tuple
of
attribute-value
pairs
with
at
least
two
mandatory
attributes
a
unique
identifier
and
the
actual
content
of
the
digital
object
furthermore
they
consider
annotations
to
be
digital
objects
with
specific
attributes
that
is
annotations
are
specialized
digital
objects
in
the
following
we
need
terminology
to
distinguish
between
two
kinds
of
digital
objects
the
generic
ones
managed
by
the
ims
which
we
call
documents
and
the
ones
that
are
annotations
therefore
when
we
use
the
generic
term
digital
object
we
mean
a
digital
object
that
can
be
either
a
document
or
an
annotation
note
that
the
term
document
is
used
here
in
a
broad
sense
since
it
indicates
a
generic
multimedia
possibly
compound
digital
object
examples
of
such
a
broad
use
of
the
term
document
can
be
found
in
castelli
and
pagano
2002a
who
define
the
document
as
a
structured
multilingual
and
multimedia
information
object
or
in
the
document
object
model
dom
w3c
1998
where
the
term
document
indicates
many
different
kinds
of
information
that
may
be
stored
in
diverse
systems
and
much
of
this
would
traditionally
be
seen
as
data
rather
than
as
documents
finally
note
that
when
we
talk
about
annotations
we
mean
both
metadata
annotations
introduced
in
section
2
1
and
content
annotations
explained
in
section
2
2
therefore
we
consider
both
of
these
types
of
annotations
as
kinds
of
digital
objects
the
following
definition
introduces
the
different
sets
of
digital
objects
we
will
need
to
deal
with
definition
4

let
us
define
the
following
sets
--
d
is
a
set
of
documents
and
d
d
is
a
generic
document
u
d
is
a
universe
set
of
documents
which
is
the
set
of
all
the
possible
documents
so
that
d
u
d
--
a
is
a
set
of
annotations
and
a
a
is
a
generic
annotation
u
a
is
a
universe
set
of
annotations
which
is
the
set
of
all
the
possible
annotations
so
that
a
u
a
--do
d
a
is
a
set
of
digital
objects
and
do
do
is
either
a
document
or
an
annotation
udo
u
a
u
d
is
a
universe
set
of
digital

so
that

expressing
the
temporal
dimension
involved
by
annotations
the
universe
sets
u
d
u
a
and
udo
are
abstract
sets
since
they
contain
all
the
possible
needed
objects
whether
they
actually
exist
or
not
in
any
given
moment
on
the
other
hand
the
sets
d
a
and
do
are
tangible
sets
that
contain
the
objects
that
already
exist
in
a
given
moment
if
we
pick
out
an
element
from
d
a
or
do
we
are
dealing
with
a
digital
object
that
has
been
created
even
before
we
start
working
on
it
in
other
words
the
element
already
exists
the
d
a
and
do
sets
are
a
sort
of
time-variant
sets
since
we
can
add
delete
or
modify
elements
of
these
sets
over
time
on
the
other
hand
the
u
d
u
a
and
udo
sets
are
a
sort
of
time-invariant
sets
since
they
already
contain
every
possibile
object
we
may
need
to
deal
with
the
annotation
is
the
result
of
an
intellectual
task
performed
on
an
existing
digital
object
and
it
follows
an
already
existing
digital
object
therefore
the
annotation
comprises
a
temporal
dimension
which
is
often
not
explicit
but
that
limits
the
creation
of
the
annotation
to
the
existence
of
another
digital
object
this
temporal
relationship
between
the
annotation
and
the
annotated
digital
object
does
not
mean
that
the
annotation
cannot
be
considered
a
stand-alone
intellectual
task
but
it
does
impose
a
temporal
ordering
between
the
existence
of
an
annotated
digital
object
and
its
annotation
that
cannot
be
overlooked
in
conclusion
we
need
some
mechanism
for
rendering
the
time
dimension
explicit
if
necessary
we
will
illustrate
this
mechanism
by
means
of
some
examples
which
show
some
interesting
cases
please
note
that
they
do
not
aim
to
be
exhaustive
although
these
examples
do
make
use
of
the
set
do
they
have
a
more
general
validity
creation
of
a

these
three
basic
examples
reveal
our
strategy
for
addressing
the
time
dimension
--
time
k
identify
an
initial
set
do

to
work
with
--
time
k
identify
the
digital
objects
to
work
with
which
may
belong
to
do
k
or
not
if
the
identified
digital
objects
belong
to
do
k
then
they
already
exist
on
the
other
hand
if
the
identified
digital
objects
do
not
belong
to
do
k
then
they
do
not
yet
exist
and
therefore
this
step
represents
their
creation
--
time
k

identify
the
new
set
do
k
1
which
results
from
performing
the
appropriate
operations
on
the
set
and
the
digital
objects
previously
identified
in
all
of
the
cases
both
do
k
and
do
k
1
contain
only
digital
objects
that
already
exist
this
mechanism
allows
us
to
unambiguously
state
which
objects
we
are
dealing
with
in
any
given
moment
and
the
moment
when
they
are
able
to
be
utilized
do
k
and
do
k

unambiguously
identify
the
digital
objects
we
are
dealing
with
which
are
given
by
do
k
do
k
1
in
particular
the
deleted
digital
objects
are
given
by
do
k
do
k
1
and
the
newly
created
digital
objects
are
given
by
do
k
1
do
k
therefore
we
can
talk
about
the
digital
objects
identified
by
the
transition
from
do
k
to
do
k
1
we
assume
that
the
operations
previously
shown
are
atomic
no
operation
can
occur
during
the
execution
of
another
operation
so
as
to
avoid
concurrency
issues
in
conclusion
this
mechanism
provides
us
with
a
means
to
clearly
identify
which
objects
are
involved
in
a
given
operation
when
they
can
be
utilized
and
the
ordering
among
the
different
events
involved
by
an
operation
the
definitions
of
collection
c
and
repository
provided
by
goncalves
et
al
2004a
p
295
to
a
certain
extent
resemble
the
proposed
mechanism
indeed
they
model
the
storing
of
a
digital
object
in
the
repository
as
the
transition
from
the
original
repository
to
a
repository
which
manages
a
collection
augmented
by
the
newly
inserted
digital
object
similarly
the
deletion
of
a
digital
object
is
modeled
as
the
transition
from
the
original
repository
to
a
repository
which
manages
a
smaller
collection
without
the
deleted
digital
object
on
the
other
hand
the
definitions
introduced
by
goncalves
et
al
2004a
do
not
explicitly
take
into
account
and
model
the
temporal
dimension
involved
with
these
operations
in
this
sense
we
can
consider
our
mechanism
an
extension
of
the
proposal
made
by
goncalves
et
al
2004a
furthermore
our
mechanism
extends
formalizes
and
makes
more
explicit
what
rigaux
and
spyratos
2004
p
421
left
implicit
when
they
said
in
order
to
define
a
document
formally
we
assume
the
existence
of
a
countably
infinite
set
d
whose
elements
are
used
by
all
authors
for
identifying
the
created
documents
in
fact
we
assume
that
the
creation
of
a
document
is
tantamount
to
choosing
a
new
element
from
d
indeed
the
set
d
used
by
rigaux
and
spyratos
2004
corresponds
to
the
set
udo
of
definition
4
1
and
the
creation
of
a
document
corresponds
to
the
transition
from
do
k
to
do
k
1
where
an
object
from
udo
is
chosen
and
is
added
to
do
k
thus
creating
do
k
1
as
explained
above
furthermore
we
provide
a
formal
mechanism
for
describing
the
deletion
and
the
modification
of
a
digital
object
as
well
in
the
following
sections
we
will
use
the
notation
do
k
which
explicitly
points
out
the
time
dimension
only
when
needed
otherwise
we
will
use
the
simpler
notation
do
without
explicitly
pointing
out
the
time
dimension
we
will
also
use
a
similar
notation
for
the
other
sets
we
will
define
in
the
following

handle
according
to
the
previous
discussion
we
can
assume
that
each
digital
object
is
identified
by
a
unique

is
a
name
assigned
to
a
digital

to
identify
and
to
facilitate
the
referencing
process
to
the
digital

over
the
past

have
been
developed
to

for

when
they
say
a

is
a

the

the

simply
introduce

the
different
scopes
of
an

can
be
partnered
with
the
various
access
permissions
introduced
here
in
order
to
obtain
the
necessary
access
policies
for
example
in
the
case
of
a
public
annotation
we
might
decide
that
every
user
holds
read
only
access
to
it
while
its
author
has
read-
and
write-access
to
it
in
addition
to
the
policy
just
described
we
might
also
add
a
list
of
groups

each
one
with
its
specific
access
permission
in
order
to
pinpoint
finegrained
access
permission
even
in
the
context
of
a
public
annotation
therefore
the
proposed
formal
model
does
not
aim
at
describing
a
specific
access
policy
but
at
providing
the
means
for
describing
the

also

linking
in
order
to
link
annotations
to
digital
objects
and
to
correctly
anchor
annotations
to
digital
objects
we
need
to
proceed
as
follows
first
we
need
to
choose
a
linking
mechanism
and
define
the
link
types
that
can
exist
between
annotations
and
digital
objects
as
described
in
section
6
1
then
since
annotations
are
usually
linked
to
specific
parts
of
a
digital
object
we
need
to
model
the
content
of
digital
objects
as
explained
in
section
6
2
finally
a
suitable
anchoring
mechanism
for
annotations
has
to
be
provided
as
introduced
in
section
6

1
linking
annotations
to
digital
objects
handles
can
be
used
not
only
for
the
purpose
of
uniquely
identifying
a
digital
object
but
they
can
also
provide
us
with
a
means
for
linking
an
annotation
to
a
digital
object
this
use
of
handles
is
particularly
clear
if
we
think
about
urls
but
it
is
also
still
valid
in
the
case
of
the
other
types
of
handles
presented
in
section
4
3
once
we
have
decided
to
use
handles
as
a
basic
mechanism
for
linking
annotations
to
digital
objects
we
still
have
to
consider
the
kind
of
links
an
annotation
can
have
with
a
digital
object
annotations
can
be
linked
to
digital
objects
with
two
main
types
of
links
--
annotate
link
an
annotation
annotates
a
digital
object
which
can
be
a
document
or
another
annotation
the
annotate
link
is
intended
to
allow
an
annotation
to
only
annotate
one
or
more
parts
of
a
given
digital
object
therefore
this
kind
of
link
lets
the
annotation
express
intra-digital
object
relationships
meaning
that
the
annotation
creates
a
relationship
among
the
different
parts
of
the
annotated
digital
object
--
relate-to
link
an
annotation
relates
to
a
digital
object
which
can
be
a
document
or
another
annotation
the
relate-to
link
is
intended
to
allow
an
annotation
to
only
relate
to
one
or
more
parts
of
other
digital
objects
but
not
the
annotated
one
therefore
this
kind
of
link
lets
the
annotation
express
inter-digital
object
relationships
meaning
that
the
annotation
creates
a
relationship
between
the
annotated
digital
object
and
the
other
digital
objects
related
to
it
with
respect
to
these
two
main
types
of
link
we
introduce
the
following
constraint
an
annotation
must
annotate
one
and
only
one
digital
object
which
can
be
either
a
document
or
another
annotation--an
annotation
must
have
one
and
only
one
annotate
link
this
constraint
means
that
an
annotation
can
be
created
only
for
the
purpose
of
annotating
a
digital
object
and
not
exclusively
for
relating
to
a
digital
object
an
annotation
then
can
annotate
one
and
only
one
digital
object
because
the
annotate
link
expresses
intra-digital
object
relationships
and
thus
it
cannot
be
mutual
to
multiple
digital
objects
different
from
the
annotated
one
finally
this
constraint
does
not
prevent
the
annotation
from
relating
to
more
than
one
digital
object
from
having
more
than
one
relate-to
link
this
situation
is
very
similar
to
what
happens
in
the
real
world
when
we
deal
with
paper
documents
we
can
annotate
one
or
more
parts
of
the
document
that
we
have
at
hand
this
document
also
provides
us
with
the
physical
medium
for
writing
the
content
of
the
annotation
on
the
other
hand
the
content
of
the
annotation
can
contain
references
to
other
documents
in
other
words
it
can
relate
the
document
at
hand
to
other
documents
that
are
currently
being
viewed
therefore
the
act
of
annotating
concerns
one
and
only
one
document
to
which
the
annotation
is
anchored
although
there
may
be
one
or
more
references
that
relate
the
annotation
to
other
documents
one
could
argue
that
in
the
digital
world
these
limitations
could
be
overcome
and
that
an
annotation
could
annotate
multiple
documents
at
the
same
time
apart
from
being
possible
what
could
we
gain
from
this
option
if
we
allow
multiple
annotate
links
we
are
going
to
add
some
uncertainty
because
the
annotation
would
lose
its
strong
relationships
with
only
one
object
in
fact
this
object
represents
its
main
purpose
while
linking
the
annotation
to
multiple
objects
would
give
us
unclear
semantics
therefore
we
opt
for
constraining
the
link
types
that
an
annotation
can
have
and
the
following
definition
introduces
the
set
of
allowed
link
types

let
lt
be

the

and
the

the

lt
is
also
a
time-invariant
set
because
we
assume
that
an

can
be
linked
to
digital
objects
only
with
the
link
types
listed
here

stream
digital
objects
can
be
very
different--texts
images
audio
videos
hypertexts
multimedia
objects
and
so
on--and
the
way
in
which
their
structure
and
content
is
modeled
and
expressed
can
also
widely
vary
across
different
conceptual
and
logical
models
of
dl
and
digital
object
nevertheless
many
of
these
types
of
models
share
the
idea
that
beyond
representing
the
structure
of
the
digital
object
the
model
also
has
to
take
into
account
a
mechanism
for
representing
the
actual
content
of
the
digital
object
for
example
navarro
and
baeza-yates
1997
and
goncalves
et
al
2004a
both
use
the
notion
of
stream
which
is
an
ordered
sequence
of
symbols
representing
the
actual
content
of
a
digital
object
or
part
of
it
bottoni
et
al
2003
define
the
content
of
a
digital
object
as
a
function
from
a
set
of
indices
to
a
set
representing
the
vocabulary
of
the
symbols
finally
castelli
and
pagano
2002a
2002b
associate
each
digital
object
with
many
different
manifestation
entities
which
represent
sequences
of
bytes
and
files
containing
different
parts
of
the
digital
object
itself
the
following
definition
introduces
the
concept
of
stream
in
order
to
represent
the
actual
content
of
a
digital
object
or
a
part
of
it
the
definition
of
stream
is
inspired
by
navarro
and
baeza-yates
1997
and
goncalves
et
al
2004a
but
with
some
differences
which
will
be
discussed
in
the
following
definition

we
define

which
maps

be
adhered
to
h
h
hsm

each
digital

must
contain
at

could
also

be

between

u
s
m
is
the
same
as
the
one
between
the
sets

described
in
section

the
stream
is
required
to
be
neither
a
surjective
nor
an
injective
function
we
can
exploit
the
non
surjectivity
of
the
stream
in
order
to
use
standard
sets--
characters
numbers
and
so
on--as
a
codomain
for
a
stream
otherwise
if
the
function
were
constrained
to
be
surjective
we
would
be
forced
to
use
an
ad
hoc
codomain
for
each
different
stream
on
the
other
hand
since
the
stream
is
not
an
injective
function
it
is
therefore
not
invertible
in
fact
when
given
a
symbol
we
cannot
trace
this
symbol
back
to
its
position
within
the
stream
for
example
if
we
consider
the
following
piece
of
text

then
we

such
that

note
that
if
the

was
constrained
to
be

we
should
use
a
codomain
constituted

in
any
case
the
letters
of
the
piece
of
text
shown
above
from
a
given
symbol
for
example
t
we
cannot
unambiguously
determine
its
position
in
the
stream
because
the
stream
is
not
injective--
t
is
given
by
both
sm
3
and
sm
10
in
particular
we
can
distinguish
two
main
kinds
of
streams
--
logical
stream
lsm
this
is
a
stream
in
which
each
element
represents
a
logical
symbol
within
the
stream
--
physical
stream
psm
this
is
a
stream
in
which
each
element
represents
a
physical
symbol
within
the
stream
now
we
will
discuss
the
distinction
between
logical
and
physical
streams
by
means
of
an
example
although
the
map
shown
between
natural
numbers
and
letters
is
quite
intuitive
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
elements
of
the
set
are
symbols
that
abstract
the
underlying
encoding
of
the
text
for
example
if
we
consider
an
ascii
text
each
element
of
the
set
corresponds
to
exactly
one
byte
in
the
physical
text
stream
thus
we
should
use
the
codomain
ascii
text
4116
4216
5a16
6116
6216
7a16
2016
nstead
of
to
represent
the
actual
stream
on
the
other
hand
in
the
case
of
a
unicode
text
each
element
of
the
set
corresponds
to
two
bytes
in
the
physical
text
stream
thus
we
should
use
the
codomain
unicode
0016
4116
0016
4216
0016
5a16
0016
6116
0016
6216
0016
7a16
0016
2016
instead
of
in
this
latter
case
we
are
forced
to
define
the
elements
of
unicode
as
two-byte
pairs
in
order
to
map
the
indices
of
i
into
the
symbols
of
unicode
as
a
result
we
would
not
be
able
to
access
each
byte
individually
if
we
wish
to
access
each
byte
of
the
unicode
stream
we
should
define
the
following
domain
i
1
2
20
and
codomain
unicode
0016
4116
4216
5a16
6116
6216
7a16
2016
for
the
stream
but
in
this
case
we
would
lose
the
correspondence
with
the
ten
letters
of
the
piece
of
text
because
two
indices
in
i
would
correspond
to
each
letter
of
the
piece
of
text
this
example
demonstrates
that
on
the
one
hand
we
have
a
logical
stream
which
represents
the
piece
of
text
and
on
the
other
there
are
one
or
more
physical
streams
that
represent
the
physical
encoding
of
the
piece
of
text
shown
similar
and
even
more
complex
considerations
can
be
made
in
the
case
of
audio
image
and
video
streams
where
the
complexity
of
such
streams
increases
the
choices
available
for
representing
them
both
in
logical
and
in
physical
terms
another
example
is
the
compression
of
streams
where
more
symbols
in
one
stream
correspond
to
fewer
symbols
in
the
other
stream
this
observation
points
out
the
need
to
carefully
define
the
level
of
abstraction
of
a
stream
and
the
degree
of
detail
that
need
to
be
adopted
when
defining
streams
in
other
words
should
we
model
the
physical
encoding
of
a
stream
or
some
more
abstract
representation
of
that
stream
depending
on
the
case
both
levels
of
abstraction
may
be
necessary
for
example
when
we
do
a
macrocomparison
of
two
digital
libraries
we
can
use
more
abstract
streams
on
the
other
hand
if
we
want
to
precisely
describe
the
functioning
of
some
component
of
a
digital
library
as
a
repository
we
need
to
use
streams
that
better
represent
the
physical
encoding
of
the
objects
in
the
repository
however
past
experience
in
the
field
of
dbms
teaches
us
that
it
is
better
to
keep
the
logical
and
the
physical
levels
distinct
this
is
why
we
want
to
distinguish
between
logical
and
physical
streams
note
that
navarro
and
baeza-yates
1997
make
use
of
logical
streams
but
they
do
not
specify
much
about
physical
streams
leaving
them
to
the
implementation
of
the
system
neither
bottoni
et
al
2003
nor
goncalves
et
al
2004a
addressed
this
problem
at
all
but
in
goncalves
and
fox
2002
it
turns
out
that
streams
are
essentially
identified
by
multipurpose
internet
mail
extensions
mime
types
freed
and
borenstein
1996a
1996a
1996b
moore
1996
freed
et
al
1996
and
thus
they
are
substantially
physical
streams
finally
since
the
notion
of
manifestation
used
by
castelli
and
pagano
2002b
2002a
refers
to
a
physical
file
holding
part
of
the
content
of
a
digital
object
these
authors
essentially
use
physical
streams
also
and
in
a
way
that
resembles
the
implementation
of
streams
by
goncalves
and
fox
2002
we
believe
that
the
research
field
of
digital
libraries
also
needs
to
clearly
distinguish
between
the
logical
and
physical
levels
this
distinction
is
a
prerequisite
for
each
formal
model
of
dl
that
aims
to
be
sufficiently
clear
expressive
and
flexible
moreover
an
explicit
and
formal
mechanism
for
modeling
the
relationship
between
logical
and
physical
streams
and
the
properties
of
such
a
relationship
is
needed

will
be
the

it

and
its
unicode
encoding
--
a
many-to-one
relationship
between
the
symbols
of
the
two
streams
as
in
the
case
of
compression
of
one
stream
into
another
the
stream
mapping
relation
provides
us
with
a
further
degree
of
freedom
since
we
can
have
symbols
in
a
stream
that
do
not
correspond
to
another
stream
in
this
way
we
can
model
some
kind
of
loss
of
information
due
to
different
encodings
finally
the
stream
mapping
relation
enables
the
same
logical
symbol
to
be
encoded
in
different
ways
according
to
its
position
in
the
stream
consider
the
letter
t
which
in
the
previous
example
appears
in
the
third
and
tenth
position
of
the
stream
it
could
be
encoded
in
two
different
ways
if
we
apply
some
compression
algorithm
to
that
stream
definition

allows
us
to
associate
a
set
of
physical
streams
to
the
same
logical
stream
providing
us
with
a
mechanism
to
enable
different
encodings
of
the
same
logical
stream
we
could
also
create
a
chain
of
streams
we
could
specify
that
a
logical
stream
is
encoded
with
a
given
physical
stream
and
that
this
physical
stream
is
mapped
to
another
physical
stream
and
so
on
these
observations
led
us
to
introduce
the
stream
mapping
set
which
contains
the
stream
mapping
relations
and
holds
the
intuitive
and
expected
properties
for
this
kind
of
set
--
reflexive
for
each
stream
the
obvious
mapping
of
the
stream
to
itself
exists
--
symmetric
if
we
know
how
to
map
one
stream
to
another
we
can
also
map
the
second
stream
back
to
the
first
one
--
transitive
if
we
know
the
mapping
between
one
stream
and
another
and
we
also
know
the
mapping
between
the
second
stream
and
a
third
we
know
how
to
map
the
first
to
the
third
now
we
can
study
the
impact
definition

has
on
the
set
of
streams
s
m
and
how
it
contributes
to
enforcing
the
distinction
between
the
logical
and
the
physical
levels
proposition

the
following
relation
sms

s

is
an

relation
on
the

s

the

s

sm1

sms
are
the
equivalence
classes
of
all
the
streams
of
s

that
are
mapped

to

and
s

is
the

proof
the

is

therefore
it
is
an
equivalence
relation
we
can
choose
the
logical
stream
as
representative
of
the
equivalence
class
the
sms
equivalence
relation
allows
us
to
deal
only
with
logical
streams
in
fact
it
removes
us
from
the
physical
level
and
hides
the
details
of
the
representation
and
the
encoding
of
logical
streams
into
physical
ones
therefore
the
sms
equivalence
relation
enforces
the
distinction
between
the
logical
and
the
physical
levels
and
provides
us
with
the
means
of
working
and
reasoning
at
a
logical
level
clearly
separating
it
from
the
physical
one
furthermore
we
can
iterate
this
line
of
reasoning
and
use
this
equivalence
relation
as
a
basic
mechanism
for
introducing
further
levels
of
abstraction
and
creating
a
kind
of
hierarchy
among
streams
indeed
on
the
quotient
set
sm/sm
we
could
introduce
an
equivalence
relation
similar
to
sms
in
order
to
express
the
fact
that
two
or
more
logical
streams
can
be
mapped
to
each
other
this
is
how
we
can
maintain
more
abstract
classes
of
equivalent
logical
streams
on
the
quotient
set
sm/sm
by
keeping
them
distinct
from
the
different
ways
in
which
they
can
be
encoded
this
different
encoding
is
in
turn
represented
by
the
less
abstract
equivalence
classes
on
the
set
s
m
this
procedure
can
be
repeated
as
many
times
as
needed
in
relation
to
the
number
of
levels
of
abstraction
for
example
suppose
we
have
a
piece
of
text
that
can
be
represented
either
as
a
sequence
of
characters
or
as
a
scanned
image
these
are
two
different
logical
streams
that
can
be
encoded
with
many
different
physical
streams
in
this
case
a
first
level
of
abstraction
is
to
put
all
the
physical
streams
that
encode
the
character
streams
into
one
equivalence
class
created
on
sm
and
all
the
physical
streams
that
encode
the
image
stream
into
another
equivalence
class
created
on
sm
however
a
higher
level
of
abstraction
is
to
put
both
the
equivalence
class
of
the
text
stream
and
the
equivalence
class
of
the
image
stream
into
a
new
and
more
abstract
equivalence
class
created
on
s
m/sm
in
order
to
express
the
fact
that
both
of
them
are
representations
of
the
same
piece
of
text
for
all
these
reasons
definition

and
proposition

constitute
a
step
forward
with
respect
to
previous

castelli

address
this

the

of

provided
by
both
navarro

baeza-yates
1997
and
goncalves
et

2004a
thus
we
can
utilize
the
proposed
distinction
between
logical
and
physical
streams
in
both
the
models
provided
by
navarro
and
baezayates

in

to

such

the
handles
discussed
in
section

may
be
capable
not
only
of
uniquely
identifying
a
digital
object
but
also
of
indicating
a
part
of
the
identified
digital
object
for
example
a
url
can
point
to
any
given
anchor
within
a
html
document
or
we
can
use
an
xpath
expression
to
point
to
a
specific
element
within
an
xml
document
on
the
other
hand
parts
of
a
digital
object
cannot
always
be
identified
with
an
arbitrary
degree
of
detail
for
example
a
url
cannot
point
to
a
given
word
of
a
html
document
if
this
word
is
not
marked
with
an
anchor
therefore
we
need
some
further
mechanism
for
identifying
parts
of
a
digital
object
with
the
necessary
degree
of
detail
the
following
definition
introduces
the
notion
of
segment
which
is
a
mechanism
for
selecting
parts
of
a
stream
this
mechanism
can
be
partnered
with
the
handle
of

to
provide
access
to
a
digital

resembles
the
definition
of
segment
provided
in
navarro
and
baeza-yates
1997
and
goncalves
et
al
2004a
we
can
assume
that
logically
related
symbols
of
logical
streams
are
contiguous
and
are
in
an
ascending
order
this
assumption
goes
well
with
definition

which
selects
a
series
of
contiguous
symbols
on
the

hand
definition

allows
us
to
disregard
this
constraint
for
the
mapping
to
physical
streams
since
the
stream
mapping
relation
smr
allows
us
to
map
the
contiguous
symbols
of
the
logical
stream
to
noncontiguous
symbols
of
the
physical
stream
for
example
the
indices
ilsm

of
a
logical

could
be
mapped
to
the

of
a
physical
stream
if
we
choose
the
segment

which
is
associated
with
the
interval

for
the
logical
stream
we
are
not
forced
to
map
it
to
the
interval

obtained
by
mapping
the
segment
stlsm
to
a
corresponding
segment
stpsm

of
the
physical
stream
on
the
contrary
we
can
map
each
index
in
the
interval

to
its
corresponding
index
in
the
physical
stream
obtaining
the
set
of

which
do

see
navarro
and
baeza-yates

for
further
explanation
about
ordering
in
multimedia
streams
this
feature
is
important
because
symbols
that
are
contiguous
in
a
logical
stream
can
correspond
to
non-contiguous
symbols
in
a
physical
stream
due
to
some
kind
of
compression
for
example
in
addition
proposition
6
4
allows
us
to
reason
only
in
terms
of
logical
streams
that
comply
with
the
assumption
made
above
without
worrying
about
the
physical
streams
that
are
in
the
same
equivalence
class
of
the
logical
stream
this
observation
further
highlights
the
benefits
that
may
arise
by
clearly
distinguishing
between
the
logical
and
the
physical
levels
all
of
the
introduced
concepts
namely
handle
stream
and
segment
provide
us
with
the
formal
means
needed
to
deal
with
the
linking
and
anchoring
problem
related
to
annotations
by
using
a
handle
h
we
can
link
an
annotation
to
a
digital
object
then
the
function
hsm
h
allows
us
to
select
the
desired
stream
sm
of
the
digital
object
identified
by
h
be
it
a
physical
or
a
logical
view
of
the
actual
content
of
the
digital
object
finally
a
segment
stsm
enables
the
fine-tuned
anchoring
of
the
annotation
to
the
digital
object
last
we
can
also
rely
on
these
concepts
to
address
the
annotation
repositioning
problem
that
arises
when
the
content
of
annotated
digital
objects
changes
indeed
the
introduced
concepts
offer
us
the
possibility
of
modeling
what
phelps
and
wilensky
2000b
call
robust
location
which
are
redundant
descriptors
of
locations
within
a
digital
object
created
by
using
a
number
of
different
data
records
moreover
we
can
also
express
the
algorithms
they
propose
for
reattaching
annotations
to
a
digital
object
when
the
annotated
digital
object
is
modified
furthermore
these
concepts
can
provide
us
with
a
common
grounding
not
only
for
designing
repositioning
algorithms
as
in
the
case
of
phelps
and
wilensky
2000b
but
also
for
studying
and
describing
what
users
expect
an
annotation
system
to
do
when
annotated
digital
objects
change
as
done
in
the
user
study
conducted
by

materialization
as
in
agosti
and
ferro
2003a
we
define
sign
of
annotation
as
the
basic
way
in
which
an
annotation
can
take
shape
the
way
of
representing
and
materializing
the
semantics
of
annotation
for
example
we
can
identify
the
following
basic
signs
of
annotations
--
textual
sign
a
textual
materialization
of
the
semantics
of
an
annotation
which
is
expressed
by
a
piece
of
text
added
to
a
digital
object
--graphic
sign
the
graphic
materialization
of
the
semantics
of
an
annotation
which
is
expressed
by
a
graphic
mark
added
to
a
digital
object
--video
sign
the
video
materialization
of
the
semantics
of
an
annotation
which
is
expressed
by
a
video
fragment
added
to
a
digital
object
--auditive
sign
the
auditive
materialization
of
the
semantics
of
an
annotation
which
is
expressed
by
an
audio
fragment
added
to
a
digital
object
these
basic
signs
can
be
combined
to
express
more
complex
signs
of
annotation
consider
the
example
of
figure
2
where
two
annotations
are
shown
one
in
the
upper
part
near
the
auditive
sign
bullet
and
the
other
in
the
lower
part
near
the
auditive
sign
bullet
the
first
annotation
is
constituted
by
both
a
basic
sign
and
a
compound
sign
the
highlight
is
a
basic
graphic
sign
while
the
call-out
is
a
compound
sign
it
is
in
turn
formed
by
two
graphic
signs
the
box
and
the
arrow
and
by
a
textual
sign
which
is
the
question
wouldn
t
also
it
be
useful
for
visually
impaired
people
the
second
annotation
is
made
by
three
basic
signs
two
graphic
signs
the
arrow
and
the
cloud
and
a
textual
sign
which
is
the
answer
i
think
so
in
conclusion
by
using
the
notion
of
sign
of
annotation
we
consider
the
annotation
as
possibly
complex
multimedia
constituted
by
different
parts
each
one
with
its
own
medium
the
following
definition
formally
introduces
the
concept
of
sign
of
annotation

is
a

is
a

u

s
m
is
a

set
of
signs
of

which
is
the
set
of
all
the
possible

so
that
s
n
u

the
relationship
between
the
sets
s

and
u
s

is
the
same
as
the
relationship
between
the
sets
do
and
udo
described
in
section
4
2
henceforth
we
will
use
the
term
sign
of
annotation
or
briefly
stated
as
sign
to
indicate
a
stream
that
belongs
to
an
annotation
on
the
other
hand
we
will
use
the
term
stream
to
indicate
a
stream
that
belongs
to
a
digital
object
without
the
need
of
specifying
if
the
digital
object
is
a
document
or
an
annotation
8
semantics
as
in
agosti
and
ferro
2003a
we
define
meaning
of
annotation
as
a
main
feature
of
the
concept
of
annotation
which
identifies
conceptual
differences
within
the
semantics
of
the
annotation
or
part
of
it
for
example
looking
at
the
different
points
of
view
concerning
annotations
introduced
in
section
2
we
can
see
that
they
correspond
to
different
and
very
broad
meanings
of
annotation
furthermore
we
can
identify
different
meanings
of
annotation
within
each
given
viewpoint
for
example
within
the
viewpoint
called
annotation
as
content
we
can
identify
at
least
the
following
meanings
of
annotation
but
many
others
would
be
possible
also
depending
on
specific
domains
--
comprehension
and
study
annotating
a
document
is
a
way
of
better
investigating
and
understanding
a
concept
this
process
principally
involves
a
private
scope
because
the
recipient
of
an
annotation
is
the
person
who
created
it
other
people
reading
an
annotated
document
may
benefit
from
existing
annotations
as
well
--
interpretation
and
elucidation
annotating
a
document
could
be
a
way
of
adding
comments
and
explaining
sentences
within
it
the
aim
is
to
make
it
more
comprehensible
and
to
exchange
ideas
on
a
topic
an
example
could
be
an
expert
in
literature
who
explains
and
annotates
the
divine
comedy
this
process
principally
involves
a
public
scope
and
the
recipients
of
an
annotation
are
people
who
are
not
necessarily
related
to
the
creator
of
the
annotation
--
cooperation
and
revision
a
team
of
people
could
annotate
a
document
for
various
purposes
as
they
are
working
on
a
common
document
or
they
are
reviewing
someone
else
s
work
annotating
a
text
is
thus
a
way
of
sharing
ideas
and
opinions
in
order
to
improve
a
text
this
process
principally
involves
a
shared
scope
because
the
recipient
of
an
annotation
is
a
team
of
people
working
together
on
a
given
subject
as
a
further
example
if
we
consider
annotations
as
metadata
the
meaning
of
the
annotation
could
be
provided
by
some
standard
metadata
specification
such
as
the
ones
provided
by
the
dcmi
which
deals
with
the
development
of
interoperable
online
metadata
standards
last
it
is
also
possible
to
organize
the
meanings
of
annotations
according
to
some
kind
of
hierarchy
such
as
a
taxonomy
or
an
ontology
in
order
to
provide
navigation
capabilities
among
different
meanings
of
annotation

the

m
is
a
time-invariant

because
we
assume
that

represent
preexisting

not

over

therefore
all
the

are
already

of

goncalves
et

introduce
the
general
notion
of
structure
in
dls
rep
resented
by
a
labeled
directed
graph
as
a
means
of
expressing
different
kinds
of
structure
that
might
be
needed
in
dls
such
as
taxonomies
metadata
and
so
on
therefore
the
meanings
graph
adheres
to
this
definition
of
structure
and
it
is
a
structure
aimed
at
enabling
navigation
through
the
different
meanings
of
annotation
the
meanings
function
allows
us
to
associate
each
sign
of
annotation
with
its
corresponding
meanings
in
order
to
clarify
the
semantics
of
the
sign
note
that
the
meanings
function
is
neither
injective
nor
surjective
in
conclusion
an
annotation
is
expressed
by
one
or
more
signs
of
annotation
which
in
turn
are
characterized
by
one
or
more
meanings
of
annotation
thus
defining
the
overall
semantics
of
the
annotation
the
explicit
distinction
between
the
meaning
and
the
sign
of
annotation
is
quite
new
in
the
field
of
annotations
indeed
annotations
are
generally
typed
as
a
whole
object
according
to
some
predefined
set
of
annotation
types

but
there
is
usually
no
means
for
describing
the
semantics
of
an
annotation
with
the
necessary
level
of
precision
however
this
is
possible
with
the
meanings
of
annotation
furthermore
annotation
types
do
not
allow
any
kind
of
navigation
among
different
types
while
meanings
of
annotations
can
be
organized
to
do
that
some
helpful
information
about
the
choice
of
distinguishing
between
meaning
and
sign
of
annotation
can
be
obtained
from
the
field
of
human
computer
interaction
bottoni
et
al
1999
deal
with
visual
languages
and
define
characteristic
structures
cs
as
sets
of
image
pixels
forming
functional
or
perceptual
units
whose
recognition
results
in
the
association
of
the
cs
with
a
meaning
they
call
characteristic
patterns
cp
the
cs
along
with
descriptions
of
the
cs
and
a
relation
that
associates
descriptions
to
cs
and
viceversa
the
distinction
between
cs
and
cp
resembles
the
distinction
between
sign
and
meaning
of
annotation
fogli
et
al
2004
also
recognize
this
correspondence
and
say
that
an
annotation
is
a
complex
cs
interpreted
by
a
human
as
a
cp
on
the
other
hand
bottoni
et
al
2003
also
adopt
the
cs
and
cp
mechanism
in
the
context
of
annotations
but
they
use
this
mechanism
to
place
annotations
on
information
resources
rather
than
to
distinguish
between
the
semantics
and
the
materialization
of
annotations
we
are
interested
in
studying
the
sharing
of
common
meanings
among
different
signs
defined
as
the
basic
mechanism
for
relating
and
gathering
up
different
signs
that
express
common
semantics
this
is
very
helpful
in
the
case
of
annotations
made
by
two
different
users
for
example
they
may
use
different
signs
to
indicate
the
importance
of
a
passage--an
asterisk
or
an
exclamation
mark
knowing
that
these
two
different
signs
have
the
same
meaning
allows
these
two
users
to
communicate
and
interact
with
each
other
in
addition
this
would
also
help
us
to
disambiguate
cases
where
two
signs
that
look
exactly
the
same
have
two
different
meanings
for
example
consider
the
case
of
a
user
who
is
performing
different
tasks
while
he
is
studying
a
paper
he
may
highlight
a
passage
to
indicate
that
it
is
worth
further
investigation
while
he
is
reviewing
a
paper
he
may
highlight
a
passage
to
indicate
that
it
is
not
correct
in
both
cases
he
uses
the
same
kind
of
sign
but
with
two
different
semantics
the
most
immediate
way
of
approaching
this
issue
is
to
introduce
the
following
relation
m1
sn1
sn2
s
n
s
n
m
sn1
m
sn2
this
relation
clearly
highlights
the
signs
that
directly
share
some
common
meanings
however
this
relation
is
not
able
to
relate
two
signs
that
do
not
directly
share
a
common
meaning
therefore
a
step
forward
also
considers
both
the
meanings
graph
g
m
m
e
m
and
its
reflexive
transitive
closure
g
m
e
m
so
that
we
can

introduce
the
following
relation
m2

the
m2

means
that
two

s1
and
s2
are
in
relation
if
among
their
meanings
which
are
obtained
by
m
sn1
and
m
sn2
at
least
--
one
is
the
ancestor
of
the
other

they
both
have
a

or
--
they
both
are
the

of

or
--
two
meanings
are
equal--as
in
the
case
of
the
m1
relation
indeed
m1

is
a
very
broad
relation
that
allows
us
to
relate
different
signs
according
to
the
four
strategies
outlined
above
where
needed
we
could
use
limited
versions
of
m2
that
adopt
only
some
of
the
strategies
introduced
here--for
example
m1
uses
only
the
last
strategy
further
strategies
can
be
envisaged
to
group
signs
on
the
basis
of
their
meanings
for
example
we
could
take
into
consideration
the
predecessor
of
a
meaning
instead
of
its
ancestor
as
in
m2
therefore
the
m1
and
m2
relations
are
examples
of
the
utilization
of
the
meanings
graph
however
they
are
not
intended
to
be
exhaustive
for
example
rigaux
and
spyratos
2004
propose
a
subsumption
relation
on
the
terms
of
a
taxonomy
and
a
way
of
navigating
through
them
that
can
also
be
very
useful
in
the
context
of
the
meanings
of
annotation

annotation
we
are
now
ready
to
introduce
the
definition
of
annotation
summing
up
the
concepts
introduced
in
the
previous
sections
we
can
briefly
say
that
an
annotation
is
expressed
by
one
or
more
signs
of
annotation
such
as
a
piece
of
text
or
some
graphic
mark
which
are
the
way
an
annotation
takes
shape
the
semantics
of
each
sign
is
in
turn
defined
by
one
or
more
meanings
of
annotation
with
respect
to
the
linking
issue
an
annotation
must
annotate
one
and
only
one
digital
object
identified
by
its
handle
while
it
may
relate
to
one
or
more
digital
objects
last
the
mechanism
introduced
in
section
4
2
on
how
to
address
the
time
dimension
is
fundamental
to
properly
define
the
relationship
between
the
annotation

the
annotated

conclusion
the
first
part
of
the
annotation
tuple
is
devoted
to
providing
information
about
the

itself
because
it
specifies
the
handle
of
the

its

its
groups
of

with
their
respective

its
scope
the

the

indeed
from
definition

an
author
is
a

who
authored
at
least
one
digital

thus
if
we
had
used
the
set
of
authors
in
the
definition
of
annotation
we
would
have
constrained
the
author
of
the
annotation
to
have
authored
at
least
one
other
digital
object
besides
the
annotation
in
question
in
contrast
if
we
pick
out
a

from
the
set
of

at
time
k

we
allow
that
user
to
become
an
author
at

simply
because
he
is
authoring
the
annotation
at
hand
moreover
in
contrast
to
the
case
of
the
generic
digital
object
introduced
in
section
5
1
the
annotation
is
constrained
to
be
authored
by
one
and
only
one
author
in
the
following
section
we
will
discuss
the
meaning
of
the
aa
relation
and
the
four
constraints
introduced
in
the
definition
of
annotation
in
more
detail
discussion
about
the
aa
relation
the
aa
relation
makes
extensive
use
of
the
mechanism
introduced
in
section
4
2
for
addressing
the
time
dimension
in
particular
the
aa
relation
aims
to
demonstrate
that
an
annotation
must
annotate
or
relate
to
digital
objects
that
already
exist
for
this
reason
in
definition
9
1
the
annotation
a
belongs
to
a
k
while
the
annotated
or
related
digital
objects
belong
to
do
k
-
1
and
are
identified
by
their
handles
in
h
k
-
1
this
notation
underlines
the
fact
that
the
annotation
belongs
to
the
set
of
digital
objects
at
time
k
but
it
works
with
the
previously
existing
digital
objects
that
belong
to
the
set
of
digital
objects
at
time
k
-
1
therefore
an
annotation
can
only
annotate
or
relate
to
already
existing
digital
objects
which
is
quite
intuitive
but
needs
to
be
properly
formalized
a
very
important
consequence
of
this
choice
is
that
ha
ha
in
fact
ha
h
k
h
k
-
1
while
ha
h
k
-
1
ha
is
precisely
the
handle
identified
by
the
transition
from
h
k
-
1
to
h
k
as
explained
in
section
4
2
therefore
an
annotation
cannot
be
self-referential
it
cannot
annotate
or
relate
to
itself
since
a
self-referential
annotation
would
be
useless
the
aa
relation
makes
use
of
the
set
of
signs
s
n
k
at
time
k
to
indicate
that
they
represent
the
signs
created
precisely
for
the
annotation
a
furthermore
aa
uses
the
set
of
segments
st
k
at
time
k
to
indicate
that
those
segments
are
created
solely
to
allow
the
annotation
a
to
point
to
the
requested
part
of
the
streams
contained
in
s
m
k
-
1
if
we
consider
the
mechanism
introduced
in
section
4
2
for
formalizing
the
temporal
dimension
when
at
time
k
-
1
we
pick
out
a
new
segment
stsm
st
k
-
1
u
st
it
can
refer
to
a
stream
sm
s
m
k
-
1
in
fact
that
stream
already
exists
at
time
k
-
1
even
though
the
new
segment
belongs
to
the
set
of
segment
st
k
only
at
time
k
note
that
the
aa
relation
uses
the
set
of
streams
s
m
k
-
1
at
time
k
-
1
because
those
are
the
streams
that
belong
to
the
digital
objects
identified
by
their
handles
in
h
k
-
1
in
conclusion
we
deal
with
digital
objects
and
their
corresponding
streams
which
already
exist
at
time
k
-
1
and
which
are
annotated
or
related
by
using
signs
and
segments
that
have
just
been
created
for
the
annotation
a
at
time
k
in
the
aa
relation
both
segments
and
streams
play
a
very
important
role
in
allowing
an
annotation
to
annotate
or
relate
to
the
requested
part
of
a
digital
object
in
this
context
the
distinction
between
logical
and
physical
streams
and
the
possibility
of
using
the
logical
streams
as
representatives
of
their
equivalence
classes
becomes
a
fundamental
issue
we
can
always
suppose
that
an
annotation
deals
with
logical
streams
because
the
mapping
to
different
physical
streams
is
correctly
managed
by
the
notion
of
the
stream
mapping
relation
as
introduced
in
section
6
2
in
this
way
an
annotation
can
annotate
a
logical
stream
and
it
is
also
implicitly
annotating
all
of
the
physical
streams
that
are
in
the
same
equivalence
class
of
the
logical
stream
furthermore
as
discussed
in
section
6
2
an
annotation
could
annotate
abstract
streams
belonging
to
equivalence
classes
created
on
the
quotient
set
s
m/sm
in
this
way
it
obtains
access
to
an
entire
hierarchy
of
different
representations
of
the
content
of
a
digital
object
last
logical
streams
simplify
the
use
of
segments
because
we
can
always
refer
to
contiguous
indices
in
the
logical
streams
even
though
they
are
not
contiguous
in
the
physical
streams
as
observed
in
section
6
3
this
possibility
makes
it
easier
to
determine
which
part
of
the
digital
object
is
being
annotated
or
related
because
we
can
always
make
the
assumption
that
we
are
dealing
with
contiguous
indices
in
the
stream
of
the
digital
object
last
the
aa
relation
does
not
explicitly
make
use
of
the
meanings
of
the
annotation
even
though
they
are
a
fundamental
part
of
our
model
as
explained
in
section
8
the
meanings
of
annotation
represent
a
kind
of
preexisting
and
superimposed
knowledge
which
does
not
belong
to
any
specific
sign
of
annotation
in
particular
but
rather
should
be
shared
by
different
signs
of
annotation
to
support
cooperation
and
interoperability
in
this
sense
the
meanings
of
annotation
are
not
directly
part
of
any
specific
annotation
on
the
other
hand
as
introduced
in
definition
8
1
the
meanings
function
m
allows
us
to
associate
each
sign
of
annotation
with
its
corresponding
meaning
of
annotation
therefore
for
each
sign
sn
s
na
we
can
use
m
sn
to
obtain
its
meanings
of
annotation
and
we
can
then
exploit
and
navigate
the
meanings
graph
if
necessary
discussion
about
the
constraints
of
the
annotation
the
first
two
constraints
are
intra-annotation
constraints
because
they
limit
the
aa
relation
which
is
the
core
of
the
annotation
the
second
two
constraints
instead
are
inter-annotation
constraints
because
they
regulate
the
relationships
of
the
annotation
with
respect
to
other
annotations
the
first
constraint
imposes
the
existence
and
uniqueness
of
the
annotated
digital
object
and
prevents
the
annotated
digital
object
from
being
related
as
well
in
this
way
the
constraint
introduced
in
section
6
1
an
annotation
must
annotate
one
and
only
one
digital
object
either
a
document
or
another
annotation
hence
an
annotation
must
have
one
and
only
one
annotate
link
is
complied
with
furthermore
it
enforces
the
distinction
between
the
annotate
link
and
the
relate-to
link
because
the
annotated
digital
object
cannot
also
be
related
therefore
it
underlines
the
fact
that
the
role
of
the
annotate
link
is
to
express
intradigital
object
relationships
while
the
relate-to
link
is
requested
to
express
only
interdigital
object
relationships
furthermore
each
sign
must
cooperate--once
and
only
once--in
expressing
such
intra-do
relationships
there
is
no
sign
whose
only
link
is
the
relate-to
link
a

of
this
constraint
is

the
second
constraint
aims
at
keeping
the
semantics
of
a
sign
as
clear
as
possibile
if
a
sign
sn
could
be
related
to
more
digital
objects
it
would
not
be
clear
which
of
its
meanings--given
by
m
sn
--should
be
applied
to
each
related
digital
object
in
conclusion
this
constraint
together
with
the
first
constraint
states
that
a
sign
of
annotation
must
annotate
one
and
only
one
segment
of
a
digital
object
and
it
may
relate
to
one
and
only
one
segment
of
another
digital
object
the
third
constraint
ensures
that
the
signs
of
an
annotation
are
not
shared
with
any
other
annotation
to
preserve
the
mechanism
of
sharing
common
semantics
among
annotations
as
explained
in
section
8
the
sharing
of
meanings
of
annotation
by
means
of
the
m1
and
m2
relations
is
the
mechanism
for
pointing
out
common
semantics
among
annotations
on
the
other
hand
the
direct
sharing
of
signs
of
annotation
could
be
misleading
in
fact
a
sign
is
a
materialization
of
a
meaning
the
same
sign
might
be
used
by
different
users
with
completely
different
semantics
while
different
signs
used
by
different
users
might
have
the
same
semantics
consider
for
example
two
users
who
use
the
star
symbol
one
uses
it
to
indicate
an
important
passage
while
the
other
uses
it
to
indicate
a
wrong
passage
in
this
case
we
have
two
signs
that
look
exactly
the
same
but
have
two
completely
different
meanings
another
situation
would
be
where
two
users
use
the
star
symbol
and
the
exclamation
mark
both
to
indicate
an
important
passage
in
this
case
we
have
two
signs
that
look
different
but
have
the
same
meaning
therefore
the
cooperation
among
users
happens
by
sharing
common
meanings
which
are
connected
by
way
of
the
meanings
graph
and
not
by
directly
sharing
signs
which
may
be
misleading
or
incoherent
finally
note
that
this
constraint
does
not
prevent
the
existence
of
two
signs
looking
exactly
the
same
but
it
means
that
these
two
signs
are
different
elements
in
the
set
s
n
the
fourth
constraint
prevents
pathologic
situations
such
as
for
example
a
public
annotation
that
annotates
or
relates
to
a
private
annotation
in
such
cases
there
is
a
scope
conflict
using
the
previously
mentioned
example
the
author
of
the
private
annotation
can
see
both
the
public
and
the
private
annotations
but
another
user
can
see
only
the
public
annotation
which
is
annotating
something
hidden
to
this
user
as
a
further
example
a
shared
annotation
for
which
a
given
group
has
denied
access
permission
should
not
be
annotated
by
or
related
to
another
shared
annotation
for
which
the
same
group
has
read
and
write
access
permission
because
in
this
case
we
would
obtain
an
access
permission
conflict
the
situation
may
be
even
more
complicated
if
both
scope
and
access
permission
conflicts
happen
at
the
same
time
to
avoid
such
situations
the
conflict
detector
cd
function
has
been
introduced
which
returns
1
if
there
is
any
kind
of
conflict
and
0
otherwise
as
we
introduced
in
sections
5
2
and
5
3
the
concepts
of
access
permission
and
scope
of
annotation
are
not
intended
to
enforce
a
specific
access
policy
but
rather
to
provide
us
with
the
means
of
expressing
any
necessary
access
policy
as
a
consequence
the
actual
definition
of
the
conflict
detector
function
has
to
be
done
case
by
case
in
order
to
carry
out
the
necessary
access
policy
we
cannot
provide
an
a
priori
definition
of
it
that
is
appropriate
for
all
cases
for
example
if
we
set
the
following
rules
--
a
public
annotation
a1
can
be
freely
annotated
or
related
to
by
any
annotation
a
without
further
restrictions
--
a
shared
annotation
a1
can
be
annotated
or
related
to
only
by
a
shared
or
private
annotation
a
in
the
case
of
a
private
annotation
a
the
author
of
the
annotation
a
must
belong
to
at
least
one
of
the
groups
of
users
sharing
the
annotation
a1
provided
that
the
access
permission
for
that
group
is
not
denied
in
a1
in
the
case
of
a
shared
annotation
a
all
of
the
groups
of
users
sharing
the
annotation
a
must
also
be
sharing
the
annotation
a1
provided
that
none
of
them
has
been
denied
access
permission
in
a1
it
follows
that
a
shared
annotation
cannot
be
annotated
by
or
related
to
a
public
annotation
--
a
private
annotation
a1
can
be
annotated
or
related
to
only
by
a
private
annotation
a
provided
that
they
have
the
same
author
it
follows
that
a
private
annotation
can
be
annotated
by
or
related
to
neither
a
public
annotation
nor
a
shared
annotation
then
we
can

document-annotation
hypertext
as
explained
in
section
3
we
consider
that
existing
digital
objects
and
annotations
constitute
a
hypertext
the
definition
and
the
properties
of
this
hypertext
directly
follow
from
the
definition
of
annotation
we
provided
in
the
previous
sections
therefore
we
can
consider
the
document-annotation
hypertext
as
a
kind
of
view
of
the
set
of
documents
and
annotations
the
aim
is
to
mask
all
of
the
details
involved
by
the
definition
of
the
annotation
itself
and
to
provide
us
with
a
more
abstract
representation
of
the
objects
we
dealt
with
and
of
their
structural
relationships
we
will
introduce
the
definition
of
document-annotation
hypertext
and
we
will
study
its
properties
by
directly
using
the
set
of
digital
objects
do
and
the
set
of
annotations
a
in
the
following
we
will
not
make
use
of
the
set
of
handles
h
as
might
be
expected
from
the
previous
discussion
where
annotations
can
be
linked
to
digital
objects
only
by
using
their
handles
this
choice
allows
us
to
explain
the
properties
of
the
document-annotation
hypertext
in
a
clearer
and
more
intuitive
way
than
doing
so
by
using
handles
which
would
just
add
a
further
level
of
indirection
indeed
if
we
used
handles
instead
of
digital
objects
in
the
explanation
we
would
have
to
map
each
handle
back
to
the
corresponding
digital
object
by
using
the
h
function
in
order
to
exploit
the
characteristics
of
the
digital
object
in
the
reasoning
about
the
document-annotation
hypertext
on
the
other
hand
since
the
h
function
is
bijective
we
are
sure
that
the
properties
of
the
document-annotation
hypertext
demonstrated
by
directly
using
digital
objects
hold
and
are
valid
even
in
the
case
of
the
use
of
handles
this
is
quite
important
because
according
to
the
line
of
reasoning
developed
in
the
previous
sections
we
may
not
directly
deal
with
documents
which
could
be
independently
managed
by
external
dlms
but
we
will
always
have
the
possibility
of
referring
to
those
digital
objects
by
using
their
handles
in
conclusion
the
actual
document-annotation
hypertext
could
be
constructed
by
using
the
handles
of
the
digital
objects
even
though
its
properties
are
better
explained
and
demonstrated
by
directly
using
the
digital
objects

conclusions
and
future
work
we
have
discussed
the
problem
of
providing
users
with
annotations
on
different
kinds
of
digital
objects
managed
by
ims
that
can
range
from
dbms
to
dlms
in
particular
we
have
addressed
this
problem
in
the
context
of
dlms
and
their
evolution
delos
2004
ioannidis
et
al
2005
candela
et
al
2006
to
this
end
annotations
have
been
studied
and
formalized
as
an
effective
tool
suitable
for
enabling
and
carrying
out
the
evolution
of
dlms
we
have
introduced
the
distinction
between
the
meaning
and
the
sign
of
an
annotation
this
distinction
has
allowed
us
to
better
describe
both
the
semantics
and
the
materialization
of
the
annotation
and
to
adopt
a
flexible
approach
in
modeling
annotations
in
fact
this
gives
us
the
opportunity
to
deal
with
the
semantics
of
annotations
in
a
flexible
way
avoiding
predefined
types
and
making
it
possible
to
exploit
them
as
an
effective
collaboration
tool
for
users
we
have
proposed
a
formal
model
of
annotations
on
digital
content
which
until
now
has
been
absent
from
the
literature
concerning
annotations
this
formal
model
not
only
captures
all
the
aspects
we
have
described
but
it
also
effectively
formalizes
the
time
dimension
entailed
by
annotations
furthermore
it
introduces
the
notion
of
document-annotation
hypertext
and
explores
some
of
its
properties
finally
it
provides
us
with
a
sound
theoretical
basis
for
future
research
on
this
matter
future
research
work
will
concern
the
use
of
annotations
in
order
to
search
for
documents
and
the
proposed
formal
model
constitutes
the
necessary
groundwork
to
be
able
to
design
and
formalize
search
algorithms
and
to
express
query
languages
that
take
annotations
into
account
annotations
provide
us
with
an
additional
source
of
evidence
which
is
complementary
to
that
already
contained
in
the
set
of
documents
therefore
we
can
exploit
annotations
with
the
two
final
goals
of
retrieving
more
relevant
documents
and
ranking
them
better
furthermore
the
paths
that
connect
annotations
to
documents
become
the
vehicle
for
moving
this
further
source
of
evidence
towards
the
documents
in
fact
the
document-annotation
hypertext
is
the
basic
infrastructure
for
combining
the
sources
of
evidence
that
come
from
documents
and
annotations
we
have
already
started
to
work
on
this
problem
in
the
context
of
data
fusion
agosti
and
ferro
2005b
2006
this
is
because
we
need
to
combine
the
source
of
evidence
which
comes
from
annotations
with
the
source
which
comes
from
documents
for
the
future
we
plan
to
employ
both
hypertext
information
retrieval
agosti
and
smeaton
1996
and
link
fusion
techniques
xi
et
al
2004
for
designing
advanced
search
algorithms
that
involve
annotations
based
on
our
formal
model
once
we
have
developed
search
strategies
that
exploit
annotations
we
will
therefore
need
to
evaluate
their
retrieval
performances
by
using
standard
information
retrieval
methodologies
we
plan
to
adopt
the
cranfield
methodology
cleverdon
1997
which
makes
use
of
experimental
collections
to
measure
the
performances
of
an
information
retrieval
system
the
performances
are
measured
by
using
the
standard
precision
and
recall
figures
van
rijsbergen
1979
salton
and
mcgill
1983
but
according
to
hull
1993
we
also
need
a
statistical
methodology
for
judging
whether
the
measured
performances
can
be
considered
statistically
significant
the
next
step
will
be
to
investigate
the
possibility
of
using
measures
that
differ
from
precision
and
recall
and
are
better
tailored
to
the
features
of
annotations
finally
there
is
a
lack
of
experimental
test
collections
with
annotated
digital
contents
we
have
already
started
to
work
on
this
problem
agosti
et
al
2007b
and
our
future
research
work
will
also
concern
the
design
and
development
of
this
kind
of
test
collection
