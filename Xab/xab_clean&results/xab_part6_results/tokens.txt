when
directly
manipulating
3d
objects
in
an
immersive
environment
we
cannot
normally
achieve
the
accuracy
and
control
that
we
have
in
the
real
world
this
reduced
accuracy
stems
from
hand
instability
we
present
prism
which
dynamically
adjusts
the
c/d
ratio
between
the
hand
and
the
controlled
object
to
provide
increased
control
when
moving
slowly
and
direct
unconstrained
interaction
when
moving
rapidly
we
describe
prism
object
translation
and
rotation
and
present
user
studies
demonstrating
their
effectiveness
in
addition
we
describe
a
prismenhanced
version
of
ray
casting
which
is
shown
to
increase
the
speed
and
accuracy
of

selection

introduction
designing
models
within
immersive
virtual
environments
is
unique
in
that
we
directly
manipulate
objects
in
a
manner
similar
to
how
we
work
in
the
physical
world
direct
3d
interaction
offers
a
highly
intuitive
and
transparent
user
interface
in
contrast
to
using
a
mouse
and
keyboard
to
indirectly
control
a
3d
model
through
two-dimensional
abstractions
a
significant
drawback
of
direct
interaction
however
is
the
limited
accuracy
and
fidelity
of
interactions
in
the
physical
world
we
use
an
object
s
weight
and
inertia
along
with
friction
and
supporting
objects
to
control
our
hand
movements
and
counteract
hand
instability
in
the
virtual
world
these
aids
are
normally
not
at
our
disposal
and
hand
instability
dramatically
reduces
the
accuracy
with
which
we
interact
with
the
world
hand
instability
affects
many
of
the
design
choices
made
when
developing
an
immersive
application
objects
must
be
large
enough
to
be
easily
selected
limiting
the
complexity
of
the
world
in
which
a
user
can
work
once
the
object
is
selected
the
user
must
be
able
to
precisely
specify
its
final
position
and
orientation
one
might
provide
anchor
mapes
and
moshell
1995
and
grid
points
beir
1990
which
snap
the
object
to
predefined
and
thus
limited
positions
and
orientations
in
the
world
another
technique
is
to
explicitly
zoom
in
or
scale
up
the
workspace
in
order
to
work
in
small
areas
and
make
fine
adjustments
to
objects
mine
et
al
1997
bederson
et
al
2000
this
works
well
in
some
instances
but
in
an
immersive
environment
occlusion
and
the
loss
of
context
can
be
problematic
the
virtual
inertia
technique
ruddle
et
al
2002
addresses
hand
instability
directly
by
making
objects
resistant
to
movement
limiting
the
rate
in
which
they
can
be
moved
virtual
inertia
does
not
support
unconstrained
motion
when
precision
is
not
desired
however
yet
another
approach
is
to
use
indirect
object
control
perhaps
a
3d
menu
slider
or
button
once
again
hand
instability
limits
the
design
of
these
widgets
requiring
them
to
be
larger
than
their
2d
desktop
counterparts
the
increased
size
of
widgets
limits
the
number
of
widgets
that
can
simultaneously
be
placed
within
a
comfortable
working
space
we
present
a
3d
interaction
technique
called
prism
precise
and
rapid
interaction
through
scaled
manipulation
the
goal
of
prism
is
to
increase
the
accuracy
and
control
of
the
user
in
a
virtual
world
to
a
level
closer
to
what
they
are
accustomed
to
in
the
physical
world
prism
increases
the
control/display
cd
ratio
which
causes
the
cursor
or
object
to
move
and
rotate
more
slowly
than
the
user
s
hand
reducing
the
effect
of
hand
instability
one
challenge
of
improving
precision
is
deciding
how
to
constrain
interaction
without
sacrificing
speed
when
precision
is
not
desired
scaling
the
movement
and
rotation
of
the
hand
slows
the
speed
of
interaction
and
is
only
suitable
when
the
user
is
interested
in
accuracy
this
suggests
the
need
for
two
distinct
modes
one
that
scales
hand
movement
when
accuracy
and
precision
is
needed
and
one
that
provides
direct
unconstrained
interaction
when
moving
the
object
from
one
general
location
or
orientation
to
another
one
method
to
provide
these
two
modes
requires
the
user
to
explicitly
indicate
what
mode
is
desired
perhaps
through
a
menu
button
or
other
control
metaphor
recalling
fitts
law
fitts
1954
however
the
user
is
continuously
providing
the
interface
a
clue
as
to
whether
they
have
a
precise
goal
in
mind
fitts
law
states
that
as
the
target
gets
smaller
we
must
slow
our
hand
movement
conversely
if
the
target
is
large
we
can
and
will
move
more
quickly
this
implies
that
when
the
user
is
moving
their
hand
slowly
they
are
likely
to
have
a
precise
position
or
orientation
in
mind
prism
uses
this
premise
to
dynamically
adjust
the
cd
ratio
according
to
the
user
s
current
hand
speed
as
the
speed
of
the
hand
decreases
prism
increases
the
cd
ratio
to
provide
scaled
manipulation
and
filter
out
hand
instability
as
the
speed
of
the
hand
increases
prism
reduces
the
cd
ratio
back
towards

how
much

to
provide
this
type
of

of
the

has
its
roots
in

prism
also
scales
down
the

however
it
does
so
without
requiring
an
appropriately

be
useful
possibly
working
in

with
these

although

the

prism
interaction
direct
manipulation
of
virtual
objects
normally
consists
of
grabbing
an
object
moving
it
to
a
new
location
and/or
orientation
and
releasing
it
in
our
implementation
an
object
is
grabbed
when
the
user
places
the
tip
of
a
hand-held
stylus
within
a
virtual
object
and
holds
down
the
stylus
button
while
the
user
holds
the
button
the
position
and
orientation
of
the
virtual
object
directly
follows
the
movement
of
the
stylus
the
virtual
object
is
released
when
the
stylus
button
is
released
a
specific
design
challenge
for
a
direct
manipulation
interface
in
3d
is
to
provide
the
user
with
the
ability
to
perform
deliberate
precise
fine-grained
adjustments
to
the
position
and
orientation
of
objects
without
removing
the
ability
to
move
objects
quickly
from
one
general
position
to
another
hinckley
et
al
1994a
this
design
goal
implies
two
distinct
modes
of
interaction
one
where
constraints
are
supplied
to
aid
in
precision
manipulation
and
another
where
the
user
directly
controls
the
movement
of
the
object
free
of
any
artificial
constraints
in
response
to
this
prism
uses
the
hand
speed
of
the
user
to
gradually
switch
between
modes
by
altering
the
control/display
ratio
as
shown
in
figure
1
prism
uses
speed
thresholds--defined
by
thee
constants--to
determine
the
cd
ratio
that
controls
the
held
object
the
first
constant
is
a
minimum
speed
mins
below
which
a
user
is
unlikely
to
be
moving
purposefully
any
motion
below
this
speed
is
most
likely
tracking
error
or
inadvertent
drift
and
the
controlled
object
is
not
moved
the
second
and
most
significant
constant
is
the
scaling
constant
sc
if
the
user
is
moving
their
hand
slower
than
this
relatively
low
speed
they
are
likely
to
have
a
precise
goal
in
mind
while
in
scaled
manipulation
prism
sets
the
cd
ratio
inversely
proportional
to
the
hand
speed
for
example
if
the
user
is
moving
or
rotating
their
hand
at
a
slow
speed
close
to
the
mins
a
very
high
cd
ratio
is
used
and
the
object
would
move
very
little
if
the
hand
speed
is
closer
to
sc
the
cd
ratio
approaches
1
and
the
controlled
object
might
move
or
rotate
90
of
the
distance
the
hand
has
moved
during
the
most
recent
sampling
interval
any
time
the
user
is
moving
their
hand
at
a
speed
above
sc
they
are
transitioned
into
imprecise
direct
manipulation
mode
and
the
object
mimics
each
movement
and
rotation
of
the
hand
implicit
in
this
method
is
the
accumulation
of
an
offset
value
representing
either
the
positional
or
angular
displacement
between
the
hand
and
the
object
being
manipulated
each
time
movement
is
scaled
the
virtual
object
moves
or
rotates
a
fraction
of
the
distance
the
hand
does
although
there
are
implementation
differences
between
the
translation
and
rotation
techniques
in
both
cases
a
third
constant
maxs
triggers
automatic
offset
recovery
once
the
speed
of
the
hand
reaches
this
threshold
the
offset
is
automatically
reduced
causing
the
object
to
catch
up
to
the
hand
as
shown
in
figure
1
maxs
is
typically
larger
than
sc
in
order
to
provide
the
user
with
a
buffer
between
speeds
that
lead
to
direct
interaction
and
speeds
that
will
trigger
automatic
offset
recovery
there
exists
an
important
relationship
between
the
scaling
constant
sc
and
the
sensitivity
and
precision
via
scaling
the
user
experiences
the
lower
the
sc
value
the
less
scaling
will
take
place
making
the
controlled
object
more
sensitive
to
hand
movement
in
contrast
a
high
sc
value
provides
more
scaling
and
the
object
will
be
resistant
to
hand
motion
giving
the
user
the
ability
to
be
more
precise
some
users
naturally
move
their
hands
more
slowly
and
steadily
than
others
and
thus
feel
more
comfortable
using
a
lower
scaling
constant
on
the
other
hand
some
users
have
a
lower
degree
of
dexterity
and
have
particular
difficulty
keeping
their
hands
steady
users
in
this
category
require
the
object
to
be
less
sensitive
to
their
movements
thus
they
are
likely
to
benefit
from
a
higher
scaling
constant
the
ability
of
the
interface
designer
to
easily
change
the
behavior
and
feel
of
prism
by
adjusting
sc
not
only
allows
it
to
be
helpful
for
different
people
with
different
skills
it
also
allows
it
to
be
applied
in
many
different
situations
or
interaction
tasks
where
users
might
require
more
or
less
sensitivity
or
accuracy

prism
translation
implementation
details
prism
uses
hand
speed
to
govern
the
cd
ratio
for
object
translation
the
hand
speed
is
determined
by
taking
a
sample
of
the
hand
position
before
each
frame
and
determining
the
speed
using
the
current
location
and
the
location
of
the
hand
500
ms
in
the
past
note
that
this
is
a
somewhat
large
interval
and
that
small
movements
back
and
forth
within
the
last
500
ms
will
not
necessarily
count
towards
the
speed
value
by
using
a
smoothed
out
speed
a
small
movement
in
the
positive
direction
quickly
followed
by
a
movement
in
the
negative
direction
will
result
in
a
total
hand
speed
below
mins
and
the
cd
ratio
will
be
set
to
nullifying
hand
movement
this
is
crucial
since
small
frequent
movements
back
and
forth
are
often
indicative
of
tracking
jitter
or
hand
instability
that
ideally
should
not
cause
the
object
to
move
intentional
hand
movement
in
a
particular
direction
will
almost
always
last
more
than
500
ms--resulting
in
a
non-zero
speed
this
interval
was
chosen
through
observation
and
proved
to
be
a
reasonable
value
for
most
users
slightly
different
intervals
may
be
more
desirable
for
specific
individuals
this
is
a
simplistic
form
of
input

to
other
techniques
designed
to
combat

this
technique
has
proved
suitable
for
our
purposes
no
subjects
in
our
experiments
have
stated
that
the
latency
introduced
by
the
use
of
this
interval
was
perceptible
or
undesirable
in
any
way
to
move
the
object
itself
prism

the
distance
and

between
the

moves
the

some
proportion
of
that

the
first
mechanism
works
when
the
user
is
in
any
mode
has
accumulated
an
offset
in
a
particular
direction
and
then
changes
direction
moving
their
hand
back
towards
the
object
under
this
circumstance
the
object
is
not
moved
until
the
hand
crosses
back
through
the
object
reducing
the
offset
to
zero
this
mechanism
was
effectively
used
as
a
clutching/ratcheting
technique
by
users
and
also
guarded
against
unintended
hand
movements
the
second
automatic
offset
recovery
technique
activates
once
the
user
s
hand
speed
exceeds
the
maxs
threshold
at
this
speed
the
user
is
likely
trying
to
move
the
object
to
a
general
location
and
is
not
concerned
with
accuracy
starting
at
the
moment
the
speed
exceeds
maxs
prism
speeds
up
the
movement
of
the
object
so
it
catches
up
to
the
hand
once
the
object
and
hand
are
at
the
same
position
the
cd
ratio
returns
to
one
if
at
any
time
during
the
recovery
period
around
one
second
the
hand
slows
below

the

is
stopped
and
the

prism
translation
operates
on
each
axis
x
y
and
z
in
world
coordinates
independently
for
instance
the
hand
speed
in
the
x
direction
only
affects
the
scaling
mode
and
movement
of
the
controlled
object
in
the

direction
this
allows
the
user
to
move
their

rapidly
in
the

direction
and
retain
direct
control
while
simultaneously
being
more
precise
in

in
the

direction
eliminating
inadvertent

prism
could
have
been
implemented
using
the
euclidean
speed
of
the
hand
to
calculate
the
mode
and
degree
of
scaling
as
well
however
this
method
would
not
eliminate
drift
to
the
same
extent
the
biggest
advantage
of
independent
scaling
is
that
it
helps
users
move
the
object
in
a
straight
line
along
a
principal
axis
the
disadvantage
is
that
prism
scales
diagonal
movement
more
than
movement
along
a
principal
axis
scaling
against
the
principal
world
axis
was
a
fairly
arbitrary
design
choice
other
options
could
be
the
principal
axis
of
the
user
view
or
perhaps
another

further

is

to
determine

moves
a

to

just
under

the

motion
in
the

is
scaled
by
a
small
amount
at
the

the

also
moved
their

down
in
vertical
direction
at
a
very
slow

indicative
of
an
inadvertent

in
their

since
the

are

manner
as

however
this
time
the

is
moved
quickly
in
both
the
horizontal

this
quick

faster
than

results
in
direct
manipulation
in

and
the

maintains
its

to

in
this
situation
the
vertical

is
completely
recovered
and
none
of
the
upward

translates
into
vertical

of

prism
rotation
implementation
details
the
prism
rotation
technique
uses
the
angular
speed
of
the
hand
and
three
constants
to
determine
the
cd
ratio
of
the
interface
when
the
hand
is
rotating
slowly
below
a
mins
value
the
cd
ratio
will
be
and
the
object
will
not
rotate
as
the
rotational
speed
of
the
hand
increases
the
cd
decreases
and
the
object
is
rotated
by
an
angle
proportional
to
the
distance
the
hand
has
rotated
in
the
most
recent
sampling
interval
as
the
angular
speed
approaches
an
sc
value
the
object
rotates
directly
with
the
hand
the
third
constant

triggers
automatic
offset

and

working
with
3d
rotation
is
more
complex
than
the
euclidean
geometry
involved
in
translation
with
translation
prism
separates
the
movement
and
speed
of
the
hand
into
three
values
corresponding
to
the
x
y
and
z
directions
the
distance
covered
in
each
of
these
directions
can
be
easily
scaled
up
or
down
while
preserving
the
general
direction
of
movement
in
three
dimensions
although
a
similar
implementation
may
be
possible
using
euler
angles
pitch
yaw
and
roll
there
are
multiple
combinations
of
these
angles
that
describe
a
single
change
in
orientation
and
it
is
difficult
to
choose
one
that
is
consistent
with
the
user
s
model
of
the
change
along
with
gimbal
lock
these
problems
make
describing
3d
rotation
using
euler
angles
a
poor
approach
instead
prism
uses
a
quaternion
representation
for
the
orientation
of
the
hand
and
the
controlled
object
the
mathematics
of
quaternions
is
more
difficult
to
understand
however
concatenation
interpolation
and
scaling
of
3d
rotations
is
more
straightforward
a
simplified
view
of
a
quaternion
is
a
four-dimensional
vector
consisting
of
a
3d
vector
v
x
y
z
and
a
real
number
w
the
real
component
w
relates
to
the
angle
rotated
around
the
axis
defined
by
the
vector
v
w
is
cos
/2
where
is
the
angle
rotated
around
v
before
each
frame
a
quaternion
representation
of
the

is

prism

the
rotational

of
the

comparing
the
current
orientation
and
the
orientation
of
the

200
ms
in

as
in

this
sampling
interval
was
determined
through
observation
and
is
less
than
its
counterpart
in
the
translation
technique
because
a
continuous
rotation
normally
has
a
shorter
duration
than
a
translation

did
not

offset
recovery
when
scaling
the
rotations
of
the
hand
during
slower
movement
an
angular
offset
will
be
accumulated
between
the
hand
and
the
controlled
object
prism
helps
the
user
visualize
this
offset
by
drawing
two
sets
of
3d
axes
as
shown
in
figure
4
a
lower
axis
follows
the
rotation
of
the
hand
while
a
upper
axis
follows
the
orientation
of
the
controlled
object
when
the
axes
are
aligned
the
hand
and
the
object
are
at
the
same
base
orientation
as
they
diverge
the
user
can
see
that
scaling
is
taking
place
through
the
separation
of
these
axes
as
an
additional
aid
for
the
user
two
arcs
are
drawn
on
the
top
right
of
the
viewing
plane
the
lower
arc
is
always
the
same
length
half
circle
but
the
upper
arc
is
scaled
in
real
time
to
show
the
user
the
current
cd
ratio
when
the
upper
arc
is
very
small
the
object
will
resist
movement
high
cd
and
when
it
is
a
half
circle
it
will
follow
the
hand
more
directly
as
with
translation
prism
rotation
automatically
reduces
the
accumulated
angular
offset
once
the
user
rotates
their
hand
beyond
the
maxs
speed
threshold
while
prism
translation
reduces
this
offset
gradually
over
one
second
prism
rotation
eliminates
the
offset
immediately
which
causes
the
object
to
align
with
the
hand
we
use
immediate
offset
reduction
because
the
amount
of
rotation
that
can
be
performed
quickly
is
quite
limited
unlike
translation
rotation
is
bounded
in
that
one
can
only
rotate
an
object
360
degrees
before
returning
to
the
same
position
further
limiting
rotation
is
the
physical
limitations
of
the
wrist--normally
a
user
can
rotate
their
wrist
no
more
than
about
180
degrees
in
one
motion
without
putting
an
undesirable
amount
of
strain
on
their
elbow
thus
using
a
gradual
offset
reduction
accelerating
the
object
would
force
the
user
to
rotate
quickly
for
a
longer
period
of
time
than
necessary
and
would
be
undesirable
for
translation
prism
also
provides
offset
recovery
whenever
an
offset
is
accumulated
in
a
particular
direction
and
the
hand
is
then
moved
back
towards
the
object
translation
can
be
easily
broken
down
into
three
orthogonal
directions
simplifying
the
implementation
of
this
form
of
recovery
for
rotation
the
quaternion
representation
of
the
hand
and
object
rotation
cannot
be
broken
down
as
easily
it
is
difficult
to
determine
how
much
motion
is
actually
aimed
at
reducing
the
offset
although
a
similar
automatic
clutching
or
ratcheting
in
this
case
may
be
possible
for
3d
rotation
we
have
not
implemented
this
form
of
offset
recovery

prism
applications
the
primary
goal
of
prism
is
to
enhance
the
precision
of
translational
and
rotational
input
coming
directly
from
the
user
s
hand
although
prism
was
designed
to
aid
in
direct
manipulation
of
virtual
objects
there
are
many
other
situations
where
the
position
and
orientation
of
the
hand
is
used
to
interact
with
the
virtual
world
or
the
interface
in
this
section
we
describe
several
situations
aside
from
direct
object
manipulation
where
prism
interaction
can
be
used

selection
by
increasing
the
precision
in
which
the
user
positions
and
orients
the
cursor
the
density
of
the
selectable
objects
within
a
confined
place
can
be
increased
without
introducing
selection
errors
one
of
the
most
fundamental
ways
of
selecting
objects
is
to
simply
move
the
cursor
controlled
by
the
user
s
hand
such
that
it
intersects
the
object
using
the
prism
translation
technique
the
position
of
the
cursor
can
be
specified
more
accurately
allowing
for
easier
selection
of
small
densely
packed
objects
this
increase
in
density
and
precision
could
improve
interaction
in
scientific
visualizations
and
surgical
training
applications
in
addition
prism
can
allow
designers
to
increase
the
density
or
decrease
the
size
of
input
widgets
such
as
the
command
control
cube
grosjean
and
coquillart
2001
without
decreasing
usability
the
command

is
a
3d
cube
divided
into
27
equally
sized
cubes
3

in
which
each
cube
represents
a
specific
command
in
order
to
invoke
a
command
the
user
must
select
one
of
the
cubes
by
placing
the
cursor
inside
it
using
prism
each
individual
cube
could
be
smaller
allowing
for
either
more
commands

etc
within
the

or
the
entire
interface
could

uniformly
saving
screen
space
other
menu
interfaces
could
benefit
from
the
same
increase
in
density
as
well
there
are
many
situations
where
users
desire
to
select
objects
beyond
arms
reach
a
common
technique
for
this
task
is
ray
casting
mine
1995
were
the
user
points
his
or
her
hand
at
the
object
of
interest
and
a
ray
is
drawn
which
extends
outwards
from
the
user
s
hand/cursor
one
problem
with
this
approach
is
that
small
rotations
of
the
wrist
sweep
out
relatively
large
arcs
at
the
end
of
the
selection
ray
which
is
shown
in
figure
6
the
increased
sensitivity
to
slight
hand
rotations
makes
it
difficult
to
select
distant
objects
that
do
not
occupy
a
large
area
in
the
viewing
plane
a
problem
noted
by
poupyrev
et
al
1997
one
solution
to
this
is
to
snap
the
ray
to
the
nearest
intersecting
object
this
method
breaks
down
when
working
in
a
cluttered
environment
where
slight
movements
of
the
wrist
cause
the
ray
to
snap
between
several
proximate
objects
our
solution
to
improve
the
accuracy
of
ray
casting
employs
prism
rotation
to
control
the
angles
swept
out
by
the
ray
when
the
user
slows
the
rotation
of
their
wrist
the
orientation
changes
are
scaled
down
which
offsets
the
amplification
of
these
rotations
at
the
other
end
of
the
ray

with

poses
another
problem
in
that

difficult

be

quite
accurately
at

evaluation
we
have
conducted
four
separate
user
studies
examining
prism
before
each
experiment
users
were
provided
with
a
training
session
requiring
them
to
complete
practice
trials
using
both
direct
manipulation
and
prism
participants
were
not
permitted
to
participate
in
more
than
one
of
the
four
experiments
the
equipment
used
included
a
four-port

most
users
gripped
the

as
they
would
a
pencil
or
pen
using
the
index
finger
to
press
the
stylus
button
however
several
used
their
thumb
to
depress
the

we
used
the
simple
virtual
environment
toolkit
kessler
et

to
implement
the
environment
the
system
rendered
the
test
environments
in
stereo
and
the
frame
rate
was
held
between
20
and
30
frames/sec
throughout
the
experiments
tracking
jitter
and
latency
were
within
expectable
limits
users
did
not
report
any
difficulties
in
each
experiment
participants
were
standing
and
free
to
walk
within

approximately
1m

completion
of
the
experiments
did
not
require
a
large

the
object
translation
task
required
the
user
to
pick
up
a
virtual
sphere
and
place
it
completely
inside
a
translucent
virtual
cube
such
that
no
part
of
the
sphere
protruded
any
side
of
the
cube
the
cube
changed
color
and
turned
opaque
each
time
the
user
positioned
the
sphere
completely
inside
the
target
and
released
the
stylus
button
to
drop
the
sphere
to
indicate
a
completion
a
short
time
later
the
sphere
re-appeared
in
its
original
starting
position
outside
the
cube
the
participants
were
asked
to
repeatedly
place
the
sphere
inside
the
cube
as
many
times
as
possible
during
the
3-minute
trial
in
each
trial
the
target
cube
became
smaller
after
each
completion
beginning
with
an
easy
difficulty
level
and
progressing
to
the
fourth
target
in
which
all
subsequent
cubes
were
very
difficult
this
variation
in
difficulty
level
was
included
to
increase
the
chance
that
all
participants
could
complete
at
least
one
target
in
a
trial
without
becoming
overly
frustrated
the
difficulty

the
user
experienced
are
summarized
in

the

the

consisted

included
two

the

was
the
interaction
technique
at
three
levels
direct
prism
with

prism
with
custom

the
custom

trials
used
a

chosen
by
the

the

was
found
to

although
target

the
sphere
still
needs

users
have
a

to
move
the
sphere
diagonally

the

of
along

prism
allowed
users
to
place
the
sphere
more
accurately
inside
targets
then
when
using
direct
manipulation
as
noted
above
difficulty
level
increased
within
each
trial
until
the
participant
reached
the
most
difficult
level
afterwards
each
target
remained
at
that
level
until
the
completion
of
the
3-minute
trial
this
meant
that
the
number
of
completed
targets
at
the
higher
difficulty
levels
varied
based
on
how
quickly
the
participant
completed
the
easier
ones
this
aspect
of
the
design
prevents
us
from
making
any
statistical
claims
as
to
how
prism
or
direct
manipulation
was
affected
by
the
difficulty
level
however
we
observed
a
clear
trend
on
the
first
two
targets
in
each
trial
the
largest
cubes
participants
did
not
have
trouble
using
prism
or
direct
manipulation
when
using
direct
manipulation
performance
dropped
off
dramatically
around
the
third
or
fourth
cube
when
using
prism
performance
did
not
noticeably
drop
off
until
the
targets
reached
their
smallest
size
and
even
then
performance
remained
acceptable
the
common
strategy
when
using
direct
manipulation
on
the
smaller
targets
was
to
rapidly
and
repeatedly
pick
up
and
drop
the
sphere--with
the
hope
that
it
would
eventually
be
dropped
in
the
correct
position
this
strategy
suggests
that
users
did
not
have
confidence
in
their
ability
to
purposefully
move
the
sphere
to
its
proper
position
this
lack
of
confidence
or
control
was
not
observed
during
the
prism
trials
although
performance
was
better
with
prism
for
both
types
of
targets
improvement
over
direct
was
reduced
when
using
rotated
targets
we
were
unable
to
determine
the
true
cause
of
this
and
none
of
the
participants
expressed
concerns
about
how
prism
was
responding
to
their
movements
most
participants
cited
difficulties
with
getting
a
good
view
of
the
target
when
asked
why
they
favored
one
set
of
targets
over
another
as
discussed
in
the
future
work
section
below
the
most
obvious
reason
performance
suffered
is
prism
s
axis-independent
scaling
which
slows
diagonal
motion
more
than
movement
along
a
principal
axis

prism
rotation
the
rotation
task
required
the
user
to
rotate
a
virtual
object
seen
in
figure
9
such
that
it
was
completely
inside
a
translucent
target
object
that
was
the
same
shape
but
slightly
larger
the
centers
of
the
object
were
always
placed
at
the
same
location
in
the
world
at
shoulder
height
and
translation
of
the
objects
was
disabled
leading
to
a
purely
rotational
task
participants
were
free
to
walk
about
the
world
as
they
wished
once
the
user
rotated
the
object
and
released
the
stylus
button
such
that
it
was
completely
inside
the
target
the
target
changed
color
and
became
opaque
to
indicate
a
completion
a
few
seconds
later
the
object
re-appeared
with
an
orientation
offset
from
the
target
the
target
orientation
was
held
constant
the
starting
orientation
of
the
mobile
object
was
randomly
selected
at
runtime
from
a
set
of
four
orientations
to
prevent
the
participant
from
being
able
to
perform
the
same
exact
rotation
repeatedly
which
could
lead
to
significant
learning
effects
each
of
the
four
orientations
required
between
50
and
80
degrees
of
rotation
about
an
arbitrary
axis
in
order
to
align
with
the
target
both
objects
were
made
up
of
nine
individual
cubes
of
equal
size
numbered
1
to
9
in
figure
10
in
order
to
record
an
alignment
the
user
needed
to
rotate
the
mobile
object
such
that
the
displacement
between
the
centers
of
each
set
of
corresponding
cubes
cube
1
in
both
the
mobile
and
target
object
were
within
a
maximum
allowed
tolerance
note
because
of
the
3d
nature
of
the
objects
it
is
impossible
to
align
the
objects
without
aligning
each
corresponding
cube
alignments
could
have
been
measured
using
the
pure
orientation
of
the
objects
however
determining
alignments
based
on
the
displacement
between
each
set
of
corresponding
cubes
is
more
straightforward
for
situations
when
translation
and
rotation
are
involved
as
is
the
case
in
section
5

this
experiment
included
two
factors
the
first
factor
was
the
interaction
technique
direct
and
prism
the
second
factor
was
target
size
or
error
tolerance
which
was
at
three
levels
described
in
table
iv
a
scaling
constant
of
30
degrees/sec
was
used
which
was
determined
from
pilot
studies
for
each
prism
trial
mins
was
set
to
1
degree/sec
and
maxs
was
at
35
degrees/sec
there
were
six
trials
each
lasting
2
minutes
users
were
asked
to
get
as
many
completions
as
possible
within
the
trial
each
user
performed
the
task
with
each
interaction
type/error
tolerance
combination
we
conducted
this
experiment
with
15
14
male
1
female
undergraduate
and
graduate
students
for
each
subject
the
trial
ordering
was
randomly
determined
note
that
the
error
tolerances
used
in
this
experiment
are
less
than
what
was
used
in
the
translation
task
more
accuracy
is
needed
based
on
pilot
studies
we
felt
users
would
be
able
to
achieve
a
higher
level
of
precision
in
a
rotation
only
task
than
they
were
able
to
achieve
with
translation
in
addition
rotation
error
propagates
when
larger
objects
are
being
used--which
is
not
the
case
with
translation
for
instance
when
rotating
an
object
2
m
long
an
error
of
just
1
degree
will
result
in
a
1
75
cm
displacement
of
the
object
at
its
end
points
the
size
of
the
target
was
not
adjusted
to
represent
the
error
tolerance
during
pilot
studies
several
users
complained
that
occasionally
the
system
did
not
register
an
alignment
even
when
the
mobile
object
appeared
to
be
completely
within
the
target
this
was
extremely
confusing
to
the
user
since
it
gave
no
indication
as
to
the
nature
of
the
misalignment
this
was
most
likely
a
visual
artifact
caused
by
the
graphics
system
the
target
object
remained
slightly
larger
than
the
mobile
object
only
so
the
geometries
of
the
objects
could
never
completely
overlap
which
caused
an
awkward
blending
of
the
objects
participants
were
told
to
align
the
two
objects
as
closely
as
possible
and
that
depending
on
the
error
tolerance
the
alignment
would
be
accepted
when
they
released
the
object
each
error
tolerance
allowed
a
larger
displacement
than
the
size
difference
between
the
target
and
mobile
object
this
ensured
any
alignment
that
appeared
to
be
completely
within
the
target
would
always
be
accepted--thus
ensuring
that
the
user
always
had
a
visual
indication
of
the
misalignment
a
wire
frame
visualization
of
the
error
tolerance
could
have
been
used
it
is
questionable
whether
users
would
have
been
able
to
effectively
use
that
type
of
feedback
however
as
it
would
be
challenging
to
identify
where
the
solid
object
was
protruding
out
of
a
wire
frame
object
by
a
small
amount

discussion
the
results
show
a
clear
increase
in
performance
when
using
prism
however
throughout
the
experiment
we
noticed
that
many
participants
had
difficulty
determining
which
way
to
rotate
the
object
in
order
to
fit
it
inside
the
target
often
the
user
would
see
the
object
protruding
out
of
a
section
of
the
target
but
could
not
determine
which
axis
to
rotate
the
object
around
in
order
to
get
the
desired
effect
these
types
of
problems
with
understanding
3d
rotation
along
with
poor
performance
in
3d
rotation
tasks
have
been
recognized
in
the
literature
parsons
1995
when
using
direct
rotation
this
was
not
as
problematic
since
accidental
rotations
of
the
hand
resulted
in
object
rotation
this
accidental
rotation
occasionally
caused
the
object
to
go
inside
the
target
on
the
easier
difficulty
levels
or
at
least
cued
the
user
as
to
which
direction
they
needed
to
rotate
the
object
on
the
more
difficult
targets
this
confusion
was
a
more
serious
problem
when
using
prism
since
prism
filters
out
much
of
the
accidental
and
unintentional
movement
the
user
needs
to
thoroughly
understand
which
direction
and
around
which
axis
they
need
to
rotate
the
object
from
observation
it
was
clear
that
once
the
user
knew
which
rotation
would
result
in
success
they
were
able
to
execute
that
rotation
far
more
effectively
with
prism
in
short
prism
enhanced
their
ability
to
rotate
objects
purposefully
but
it
was
a
detriment
if
the
user
did
not
know
which
rotation
was
needed
in
the
first
place
this
seems
to
be
a
general
problem
with
3d
rotation
rather
than
a
problem
with
prism
one
solution
might
be
to
administer
spatial
ability
tests
and
lower
the
scaling
constant
which
would
allow
for
more
unintentional
movement
for
those
who
score
poorly
we
also
suspect
that
providing
a
wire-frame
representation
showing
the
user
how
the
object
would
rotate
using
direct
manipulation
would
alleviate
some
of
this
confusion
when
using
prism
this
technique
has
been
successfully
employed
by
ruddle

2002
in

six
dof
with
prism
this
experiment
was
quite
similar
to
the
rotation-only
experiment
however
the
object
being
manipulated
was
not
constrained
to
a
fixed
position
the
mobile
object
started
approximately
0
5
meters
away
from
the
target
and
needed
to
be
translated
and
rotated
to
fit
inside
the
target
the
layout
of
the
world
mimicked
that
of
the
translation
experiment--the
target
object
and
the
starting
position
of
the
mobile
object
were
always
at
the
same
location
in
the
world
just
as
in
the
translation
experiment
the
distance
between
the
target
and
initial
position
of
the
mobile
object
ensured
that
the
task
required
both
arm/shoulder
movement
and
fine-grained
hand
motion
this
task
required
more
effort
and
skill
than
the
first
two
tasks
the
user
needed
to
accurately
control
the
position
and
orientation
of
the
object
this
is
more
difficult
because
hand
rotation
often
changes
the
hand
position
and
vice-versa

discussion
we
saw
a
number
of
outside
factors
contributing
to
performance
when
using
prism
first
it
was
quite
obvious
that
the
participants
were
having
difficulty
determining
which
direction
they
needed
to
turn
the
object
to
move
it
inside
the
target
just
as
we
saw
in
the
rotation-only
experiment
for
some
participants
there
was
even
more
confusion
due
to
the
translation
component
of
the
task
in
situations
where
a
small
rotation
would
have
moved
the
object
inside
the
target
many
participants
instead
tried
to
translate
it
repeatedly
once
again
this
type
of
confusion
favored
direct
manipulation
accidental
movement
of
the
object
at
least
gave
the
user
the
chance
of
moving
it
in
the
correct
direction
when
using
prism
this
accidental
movement
was
filtered
out
despite
this
issue
prism
outperformed
direct
manipulation
for
the
more
difficult
smaller
targets
and
we
believe
that
the
gap
between
prism
and
direct
manipulation
s
effectiveness
is
larger
than
the
results
suggest
the
increase
in
button
clicks
guessing
indicates
to
us
that
the
user
did
not
feel
confident
in
their
control
over
the
object
when
using
direct
manipulation
this
is
precisely
the
type
of
behavior
prism
is
trying
to
remedy

ray
casting
with
prism
rotation
we
implemented
ray
casting
by
drawing
a
white
line
extending
out
from
a
small
red
cone
attached
to
the
user
s
stylus
to
aid
in
targeting
a
red
sphere
was
placed
at
the
far
end
of
the
ray
far
beyond
the
targets
when
the
ray
intersected
the
target
the
far
end
of
the
ray
was
attached
to
the
object
and
the
sphere
in
the
distance
turned
green
to
indicate
that
the
target
could
be
selected
with
a
button
press
when
using
direct
manipulation
the
red
cone
attached
to
the
stylus
always
pointed
in
the
same
direction
as
the
stylus
when
using
prism
the
rotation
of
the
red
cone
was
scaled
proportionally
to
the
rotational
speed
of
the
stylus
which
can
be
seen
in
figure
13
in
pilot
studies
it
was
determined
that
the
scaling
constant
did
not
need
to
be
as
high
as
it
was
for
direct
object
rotation--the
prism
implementation
of
ray
casting
used
a
scaling
constant
of
20
degrees/second
this
experiment
required
users
to
select
small
far
away
objects
as
quickly
and
as
accurately
as
possible
each
trial
presented
the
user
with
a

of
15

that
exploded
when
selected

were

discussion
the
results
of
this
experiment
show
that
using
prism
with
ray
casting
is
extremely
effective
prism
solves
a
fundamental
problem
with
ray
casting
the
inability
to
select
small
distant
objects
carrying
this
further
it
is
likely
to
solve
the
equally
important
problem
of
not
being
able
to
accurately
move
objects
from
a
distance
the
problems
with
ray
casting
are
caused
by
the
fact
that
small
rotations
of
the
wrist
result
in
large
translations
at
the
end
of
the
ray
where
the
cursor
or
an
object
is
being
moved
this
worsens
as
the
length
of
the
ray
increases
prism
works
to
counteract
this
by
scaling
down
the
rotation
of
the
hand
or
source
object
the
red
cone
in
our
implementation
we
also
noticed
that
using
prism
for
ray
casting
encouraged
more
comfortable
hand
positions
and
movements
we
observed
that
when
users
had
difficulty
targeting
objects
with
the
directly
controlled
ray
casting
they
tended
to
point
outwards
with
their
arms
sometimes
using
two
hands
much
like
they
would
when
aiming
a
pistol
a
more
experienced
user
would
normally
shoot
from
the
hip
instead
which
is
much
less
fatiguing
prism
encouraged
the
user
to
hold
their
hand
in
a
comfortable
position
and
move
the
ray
only
by
rotating
their
wrist
this
was
partly
due
to
the
increased
ability
to
target
objects
however
prism
was
also
easier
to
use
when
the
wrist
was
the
primary
joint
involved
sweeping
out
arcs
with
the
shoulder
or
elbow
is
in
general
a
much
slower
movement
than
a
wrist
rotation
and
this
slower
rotation
forces
prism
into
scaling
mode
once
users
realized
they
could
take
advantage
of
prism
s
modal
switching
more
effectively
when
rotating
their
wrist
quickly
to
cover
larger
angular
distance
they
became
much
more
effective
of
course
when
designing
a
technique
that
requires
the
use
of
the
shoulder
or
elbow
to
rotate
something
the
scaling
constant
could
be
decreased
to
provide
direct
control
when
moving
more
slowly
however
for
traditional
ray
casting
the
scaling
constant
used
in
this
experiment
was
a
good
choice
6
future
directions
a
short-term
issue
we
would
like
to
further
investigate
is
prism
translation
specifically
the
axis-independent
scaling
technique
axis-independent
scaling
offers
a
distinct
advantage
over
uniform
scaling
it
helps
the
user
move
an
object
in
a
straight
line
or
along
a
plane
by
eliminating
drift
along
the
axis
of
movement
in
which
movement
is
slowest
unfortunately
performance
is
slowed
for
diagonal
movement
seen
in
the
tasks
with
rotated
target
cubes
in
our
user
study
in
the
future
we
plan
to
implement
a
version
of
prism
that
scales
translation
uniformly
in
all
directions
by
using
the
absolute
speed
of
the
hand
to
determine
one
true
cd
ratio
in
the
long
term
we
would
like
to
further
investigate
prism
s
applicability
to
other
tasks
and
with
a
number
of
user
interface
widgets
as
described
in
our
user
study
prism
rotation
can
enhance
selection
with
ray
casting
significantly
to
follow
this
up
we
would
like
to
work
with
user
interface
controls
such
as
menus
and
buttons
we
believe
that
by
using
a
prism
controlled
cursor
we
can
increase
touch
selection
accuracy
and
thus
decrease
the
size
of
the
typical
widgets
used
in
vr
in
addition
the
usability
of
a
world
in
miniature
wim
may
be
significantly
enhanced
through
prism
manipulation
and
we
plan
on
running
experiments
focused
on
this
7
conclusions
in
the
physical
world
we
move
and
rotate
objects
quite
accurately
by
using
friction
and
the
object
s
inertia
to
help
steady
our
movements
in
the
virtual
world
none
of
these
physical
properties
normally
exist
and
object
manipulation
is
negatively
affected
by
hand
instability
we
have
shown
in
a
series
of
user
studies
that
prism
increases
precision
and
allow
users
to
make
purposeful
and
fine-grained
adjustments
to
the
position
and
orientation
of
an
object
in
a
timely
manner
when
examining
translation
and
rotation
separately
there
was
a
statistically
significant
increase
in
performance
when
using
prism
over
direct
manipulation
with
prism
rotation
and
translation
combined
6dof
task
results
were
less
clear
however
prism
continued
to
out
perform
direct
manipulation
for
trials
requiring
very
high
precision
accuracy
was
increased
in
these
tasks
because
prism
successfully
filters
out
a
significant
amount
of
hand
instability
however
in
situations
where
there
is
absolutely
no
tolerance
for
error
other
techniques
might
be
more
appropriate
unlike
many
other
techniques
aimed
at
increasing
precision
prism
does
not
place
any
limits
on
the
granularity
in
which
the
user
can
work
with
objects
and
does
not
overconstrain
interaction
when
precision
is
not
required
by
utilizing
the
principle
of
fitts
law
prism
dynamically
adjusts
the
control/display
ratio
without
explicit
user
intervention
to
provide
extra
precision
when
moving
slowly
and
direct
unconstrained
manipulation
when
the
hand
is
moving
quickly
we
believe
that
the
natural
control
metaphor
used
by
prism
is
also
what
makes
it
so
easy
to
learn
we
have
shown
that
prism
can
also
apply
to
the
control
of
a
3d
cursor
in
particular
we
have
shown
that
a
prism-enhanced
version
of
ray
casting
can
significantly
increase
the
speed
in
which
objects
or
buttons
and
controls
can
be
selected
and
dramatically
decreases
miss
rates
prism
is
applicable
across
a
wide
variety
of
tasks
in
immersive
virtual
environments
wherever
the
hand
directly
controls
the
position
and
orientation
of
the
cursor
it
is
our
hope
that
this
increase
in
precision
will
allow
designers
to
increase
the
complexity
of
their
virtual
worlds
without
suffering
from
a
manipulation
and
interaction
bottleneck
