An Integrated Approach for Modeling Learning Patterns of Students in Web-Based Instruction: A Cognitive Style Perspective
SHERRY Y. CHEN and XIAOHUI LIU Brunel University

Web-based instruction (WBI) programs, which have been increasingly developed in educational settings, are used by diverse learners. Therefore, individual differences are key factors for the development of WBI programs. Among various dimensions of individual differences, the study presented in this article focuses on cognitive styles. More specifically, this study investigates how cognitive styles affect students' learning patterns in a WBI program with an integrated approach, utilizing both traditional statistical and data-mining techniques. The former are applied to determine whether cognitive styles significantly affected students' learning patterns. The latter use clustering and classification methods. In terms of clustering, the K-means algorithm has been employed to produce groups of students that share similar learning patterns, and subsequently the corresponding cognitive style for each group is identified. As far as classification is concerned, the students' learning patterns are analyzed using a decision tree with which eight rules are produced for the automatic identification of students' cognitive styles based on their learning patterns. The results from these techniques appear to be consistent and the overall findings suggest that cognitive styles have important effects on students' learning patterns within WBI. The findings are applied to develop a model that can support the development of WBI programs.

1. INTRODUCTION With the rapid development of information technology, the World Wide Web (Web) contains an enormous amount of information [Liaw and Huang 2006]. In particular, there has been considerable growth in the use of instructional materials over the Web [Yen and Li 2003]. Web-based instruction (WBI) has become increasingly attractive to educational settings both for financial and technological reasons [Brotherton and Abowd 2004]. These include easy updating of the material [Scarsbrook et al. 2005], remote access from everywhere and at any time [Anido et al. 2001], presentation with multiple media such as text, audio, graphics, video and animation [Masiello et al. 2005], and the realization of a learner-centered design approach [Jolliffe et al. 2001]. The learner-centered design is especially important because WBI programs are used by a diverse population of learners who have far more heterogeneous backgrounds in terms of their background, skills, and needs [Soloway and Pryor 1996; Chen and Macredie 2004]. This type of design argues that the development of an instruction program should be based on the learners' point of view [Soloway et al. 1996] and should address the needs of learners [Quintana et al. 2000]. Paying attention to learner diversity has been shown to increase student motivation to learn which, in turn, may lead to improved learning performance [Larkin-Hein and Budny 2001]. Therefore, individual differences arguably become an important consideration. A number of learnercentered studies have shown that individual differences have a strong impact on the use of instruction technology [Marchionini 1995]. An analysis of existing pedagogical studies also confirms that the successful usage of instructional technology depends on the technology itself and the learners' individual characteristics [Chou and Wang 2000]. For these reasons, research into individual differences has mushroomed over the past decade. The examined differences include cognitive styles [Workman 2004; Chen and Macredie 2004], gender differences [Beckwith et al. 2005; Roy and Chi 2003], and prior knowledge [Wang and Dwyer 2004; Mitchell et al. 2005]. Among these differences, cognitive style has been identified as one of the most pertinent factors because it refers to a user's information processing habits, representing an individual user's typical mode of perceiving, thinking, remembering, and solving problems [Messick 1976]. It has also been suggested that teachers should assess the cognitive styles of their students in order to design instructional strategies for optimal learning [Lee 1992]. In this vein, this study investigates a specific research question, "what are the effects of students' cognitive styles on their learning patterns within a Webbased instruction program?". Over the past five years, this issue has been investigated by a number of studies (e.g., Calcaterra et al. [2005]; Liegle and Janicki [2006]). While their results are useful, they only represent the tip of iceberg of what might be obtained by using advanced intelligent technologies, one of which is data mining. Data mining, also known as knowledge discovery in databases [Fayyad and Uthurusamy 1996], is an interdisciplinary area that encompasses techniques from a number of fields, including information

technology, statistical analyses, and mathematic science [Bohen et al. 2003]. A major function of data mining is to help analyze, understand, or even visualize the huge amount of data stored in databases, data warehouses, or other information repositories [Li and Shue 2004]. Recent studies suggest that data mining is a useful tool for analyzing Web usage data because it can discover regularities and hidden patterns in data [Cho et al. 2003; Ozmutlu et al. 2002].Therefore, we choose to use data mining to analyze the learning patterns of different cognitive styles in our study. The article is structured as follows. In Section 2, we briefly highlight previous work on cognitive styles in WBI and present related research on data mining. Section 3 describes the methodology used to conduct the experiment and the techniques applied to the analysis of corresponding data. Subsequently, the experimental results are presented in Section 4. It then progresses to Section 5 where we discuss the effects that cognitive styles have on students' learning patterns. Section 6 presents a mechanism to help designers develop WBI programs that can accommodate the preferences of both field-independent and field-dependent learners. Finally, conclusions are drawn and possibilities for future work are identified in Section 7.

2. BACKGROUND This section starts with a summary of the empirical findings about the effects of cognitive styles on WBI, followed by an explanation of the rationale for data mining and a review of its existing approaches and applications. 2.1 Cognitive Styles Traditional computer-based instruction programs present information in a linear fashion. WBI programs employ hypermedia techniques, which have great potential for education [Chen and Macredie 2004] and permit much more flexibility in the delivery of instruction [Yamda et al. 1995]. Learners are offered a rich exploration environment and have freedom for navigation. It can be argued that when learners are given the opportunity to move freely through a WBI program, they are able to develop their own learning patterns whose features can reflect their cognitive styles [Chen and Ford 1998; Terrell 2002]. In other words, differences in cognitive styles may lead to distinctive learning patterns. Cognitive styles refer to how individuals prefer to organize and represent information [Riding and Rayner 1998]. There are many dimensions to cognitive styles, such as visualized versus verbalized, right-brained versus left-brained, global-holistic versus focused-detailed, or field-dependent versus field-independent. Among these dimensions, field dependence/-independence has emerged as one of the most widely studied dimensions with the broadest application to problems of education [Messick 1976; Witkin et al. 1977] because it reflects how well a learner is able to restructure information based on the use of salient cues and field arrangements [Weller et al. 1994]. The key

issue of field dependence lies in the differences between field-dependent and field-independent learners, which are presented here: --Field Independence. These individuals tend to exhibit more individualistic behaviors since they are not in need of external referents to aide in the processing of information. They are more capable of developing their own internal referents and restructuring their knowledge, are better at learning impersonal abstract materials, are not easily influenced by others, and are not overly affected by the approval or disapproval of superiors. --Field Dependence. These individuals are considered to have a more social orientation than field-independent persons since they are more likely to make use of externally developed social frameworks. They tend to seek out external referents for processing and structuring their information, are better at learning material with human content, are more readily influenced by the opinions of others, and are affected by the approval or disapproval of authority figures [Witkin et al. 1977]. A number of studies investigate the relationships between the degree of field dependence and students' leaning patterns within WBI. Table I presents a list of 11 recent studies published from 2000 to 2005. As shown in this table, it is still inconclusive whether field-independent and field-dependent students have different learning patterns. In addition, these studies mainly relied on traditional statistics which, in turn, might produce insufficient data analysis. A lack of deep analysis might cause some relevant relationships to be ignored, for example, what dominant learning patterns appear in WBI and whether cognitive style is a major factor influencing students' learning patterns or if other human factors, such as prior knowledge and gender differences. To conduct such a deep analysis, there technology influence learning patterns is needed that combines statistical rigor and computational power to analyze, summarize, and interpret data effectively. Data mining is one such technology. 2.2 Data Mining Data mining is the process of extracting valuable information from large amounts of data [Hand et al. 2001]. The main difference between statistical analyses and data mining lies in the goal that is sought. The former is often used to verify prior hypotheses or existing knowledge in order to prove a known relationship [Moss and Atre 2003], while the latter is aimed at finding unexpected relationships, patterns, and interdependencies hidden in the data [Wang et al. 2002]. As opposed to traditional experiments designed to verify a priori hypothesis with statistical analyses, data mining uses the data itself to uncover relationships and patterns. In doing so, hidden relationships, patterns, and interdependencies can be discovered, predictive rules can be generated, and interesting hypotheses can be found. These are the advantages of data mining [Hedberg 1995; Gargano and Ragged 1999]. Data mining can be used to achieve different types of tasks. Based on the nature of the information extraction, these tasks can be broadly divided into three major categories: clustering, classification, and association rules [Chen

Results Field-independent students favored using the index. Conversely, field-dependent students preferred to use the map. Field-dependent learners in the breadth-first version performed better than those in the depth-first version. Conversely, field-independent students in the depth-first version outperformed those in the breadth-first version. Field-independent students had better performance in the Internet treatment than in the CD-ROM and text treatments. Field-independent students did not differ significantly from field-dependent students in their learning patterns. Field-independent students achieved superior scores in the long-page condition, whereas field-dependent students were superior in the short-page condition. Field-dependent subjects hit more often on teaching notes and other class resources than field-independent subjects. Field-independent students appreciated the fact that they could study topics in any order. However, field-dependent students felt confused over which options they should choose. Field-independent students tended to have higher online technologies self-efficacy, but they did not receive higher grades than field-dependent students. Field-dependent students used linear learning. Conversely, field-dependent students preferred nonlinear learning. There was no significant difference between field-independent and field-dependent students in their quantity of annotation. Cognitive style is a significant factor in terms of Instructional delivery modes and experience with online learning.

and Liu 2004]. Clustering, a major exploratory data analysis method (EDA) [Tukey 1977], is concerned with the division of data into groups of similar objects. Each group, called a cluster, consists of objects that are similar among themselves and dissimilar to objects of other groups [Roussinov and Zhao 2003]. This approach has the advantages of uncovering unanticipated trends, correlations, or patterns, and no assumptions are made about the structure of the data. Wang et al. [2004] have developed a recommendation system for the cosmetic business. In the system, they segmented the customers by using clustering algorithms to discover different behavior groups so that customers in the same group would have similar purchase behavior. The goal of classification is to construct a classification procedure from a set of cases whose classes are known so that such a procedure can be used to classify new cases [Liu and

Kellam 2003]. In other words, classification can be used both to understand existing data and to predict how new cases will behave. For example, Ng and Tan [2003], Brown et al. [2000], and Mateos et al. [2002] used classification to infer the functions of genes. Association rules that were first proposed by Agrawal and Srikant [1994] are mainly used to find out the meaningful relationships between items or features that occur synchronously in databases. This approach is useful when one has an idea of the different associations that are sought. This is because one can find all kinds of correlations in a large dataset. Cunningham and Frank [1999] applied the association rules to the task of detecting subject categories that co-occur in transaction records of books borrowed from a university library. A number of techniques are available to support these tasks, including decision trees, the K-means algorithm, the support vector machine, and selforganization maps. Among these, the K-means algorithm and decision trees have been widely used to analyze Web usage data. The K-means algorithm is an algorithm that can support tasks for clustering (see Section 3.3.2 for the details). This algorithm was applied in the study of Wiwattanacharoenchai and Srivihok [2003] that clustered customer segments from Web logs of various Internet banking Web sites. Consequently, their results showed that there was a clear distinction between the segments in terms of customer behavior. A similar study was conducted by Chaimeun and Srivihok [2005] who combined the K-means algorithm with self organization maps to cluster handicraft customers. In addition, Baeza-Yates et al. [2004] used the K-means algorithm to discover clusters that define textual contexts for the images on the Web. Decision trees can easily be used for performing classification tasks (see Section 3.3.3 for the details). This technique was used in the study of Lee and Yang [2003], which developed a learning agent to model a user's interests for TV program selections and to explore different program features for better recommendations. Kim et al. [2002] also used the decision tree to develop personalized recommendation procedure for an Internet shopping mall. Furthermore, Ayan et al. [2002] used the decision tree to develop a technique for automatically defining logical domains on the basis of Web page metadata. In addition to the aforementioned evidence that suggests the K-means algorithm and decision trees can provide effective approaches to examining the Web usage data, another advantage of these two techniques is that it is easy to understand how they work (see Section 3.3) and the generated results are easily understood [Mertik et al. 2004]. Moreover, they are supported by many commercial data mining software packages and thus are easily implemented in real-world applications [Ahola and Rinta-Runsala 2001]. In this article, an integrated approach that combines traditional statistics with the K-means algorithm and decision trees is selected to analyze students' learning patterns in an empirical study conducted in a WBI program. The purpose of using such an integrated approach is to bring together confirmatory analysis and exploratory analysis. In doing so, we can obtain a more complete picture, which not only shows the predefined relationships between the students' cognitive styles and their learning patterns, but can also reveal the unexpected but valuable patterns hidden in data [Hand 1999].

3. METHODOLOGY To understand the differences in learning patterns among different cognitive style groups, we conducted an experiment in a UK university. This section describes the research instruments, the experimental design, and the methods of data analyses. 3.1 Research Instruments Research instruments work as a guide in order to make sure that the same information is obtained from different students. The research instruments used in this study included a WBI program to teach students computational algorithms and Riding's Cognitive Style Analysis to measure students' cognitive styles. 3.1.1 Web-Based Instruction Programs. A WBI program was created containing materials from the Computation and Algorithms module. The program included about 75 pages and the content was divided into six sections. Interface elements included (a) a title bar located at the top of the screen showing the section name being viewed, (b) a control panel with choices for menu, map, index, and the other available sections, and (c) the main body of the tutorial, providing referenced links and subject categories for selection. Figure 1 shows the screen design of this WBI program. The design of this WBI program was underpinned by considerations of free exploration of the instructional material. The WBI program provided the students with rich links within the text as well as a variety of navigation tools, including a hierarchical map, an alphabetical index, and a main menu. In addition, each topic was further split into four display options comprising (a)

overview, (b) details, (c) examples, and (d) references. There were two types of overview, a general content overview and an overview for each specific topic. In this way, the learners were given control of deciding their own learning paths and choosing their favorite navigation tools and preferred presentation formats. Three types of learner control were available in the programs, as shown in Table II. 3.1.2 Cognitive Style Analysis. The cognitive style dimension investigated in this study was the level of field dependence. A number of instruments have been developed to measure field dependence, including the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT) by Witkin et al. [1971] and the Cognitive Styles Analysis (CSA) by Riding [1991]. The main advantage of CSA over GEFT is that fielddependent competence is positively measured rather than being inferred from poor field-independent capability [Ford and Chen 2001]. In addition, the CSA offers computerized administration and scoring and consequently has been selected as the instrument for measuring field dependence in this study. The CSA includes two subtests (Figure 2). The first presents items containing pairs of complex geometrical figures that the individual is required to judge as either the same or different. The second presents items, each comprising a simple geometrical shape, such as a square or a triangle, and a complex geometrical figure as in the GEFT. The individual is asked to indicate whether

or not the simple shape is contained in a complex one by pressing one of two marked response keys [Riding and Grimley 1999]. These two subtests have different purposes. The first subtest is a task requiring the field-dependent capacity. Conversely, the second subtest requires the disembedding capacity associated with field independence. The CSA measures what Riding and Sadler-Smith [1992] refer to as a wholist/analytic (WA) dimension, noting that this is equivalent to field dependence/independence. As Witkin et al. [1971] argued, a field-independent individual is capable of a more analytical cognitive function than a field dependent individual who uses a more global approach. Riding's [1991] recommendations are that WA scores below 1.03 denote field-dependent individuals; WA scores of 1.36 and above denote field-independent individuals; and students scoring between 1.03 and 1.35 are classed as intermediate. In this study, categorizations were based on these recommendations. As reported by Peterson et al. [2003], the reliability is r=0.81, p<0.00. 3.2 Experiment Design The experiment took place in a UK university. A request was issued to students in lectures and further by email, making clear the nature of the experiment and their participation. The students took part in the experiment a voluntary basis. The experiment consisted of two phases held on different days. Seventy-six participants took part in the first phase of the experiment, and they were asked to take Riding's CSA test to classify their cognitive styles. Once this was done, they were requested to fill out a questionnaire which was designed to identify their personal background, including their gender, the levels of their prior knowledge to subject content, and the levels of their previous system experience in using computers, the Internet, and computer-aided learning. The purpose of these activities was to select the sample for the next phase based on the participants' previous system experience and their prior knowledge of the subject content. Sixty-five students who had the basic computing and Internet skills necessary to operate the WBI program and were inexperienced in the subject content were selected to participate in the second phase. Details of the distribution of the participants for the second phase are presented in Table III. To help them use the WBI program, the second phase began by giving the students an introduction to the functionality of the WBI program. Subsequently, all of the participants interacted with the WBI program and their interactions with the program were recorded in a log file. The students were given a task sheet containing various exercises related to the content of the WBI program. The purpose of doing this is to ensure that the participants browse all contents within the WBI program. They were informed that they could use the WBI program for a maximum of 90 minutes. Due to the relatively small sample size, a within-subjects design was selected for experiment design [Reips 2000]. In this way, participants were free to choose preferred navigation tools and display options by themselves so that how cognitive styles influence their choices could be examined.

3.3 Data Analysis Raw experimental data were in the form of Web access logs and initially went through a preprocessing phase in which all damaged links were traced and removed from the database. In order to discover the relationships between students' cognitive styles and their learning patterns, it is necessary to extract the potentially useful information from raw data. The rationale of selecting useful information is based on a comprehensive review by Chen and Macredie [2002], which examined the effects of cognitive styles on student learning. In addition to their findings, the characteristics of the raw data and Web site structure were also taken into account to extract the attributes that reveal students' learning patterns in WBI. In total, there are eight attributes, including the total number of pages each student browsed, the total number of visited pages, respectively, describing overviews, examples, detailed descriptions, the total number of times each navigational tool was used, including main menu, hierarchical map and alphabetical index, and the number of repeated visits the students made. It is worth noting that the measurement of these eight attributes is based on the students' choices. In other words, this study emphasizes on students' preferred learning patterns instead of the best learning patterns because cognitive style is not a measure of intelligence or ability [Rose 1988]. In order to conduct a comprehensive evaluation, the students' learning patterns were analyzed using traditional statistical and data mining techniques. The former were applied to determine whether cognitive styles had significant effects on students' learning patterns. The latter used both clustering

and classification methods. In terms of clustering, the K-means algorithm was employed to produce groups of students that shared similar learning patterns, and subsequently the corresponding human factors for each group were identified. As far as classification is concerned, the students' learning patterns were analyzed using decision trees with which rules were produced for the automatic identification of students' cognitive styles based on their learning patterns. 3.3.1 Traditional Statistics. To determine if there are statistically significant differences among the learning patterns of three cognitive style groups, the data collected from the log file were also used for analysis with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows (release 10.0). The independent variable was the participants' cognitive styles. The dependent variables were the eight attributes described in Section 3.3. A series of ANalyses Of VAriance (ANOVA) was used to test for differences in each of the dependent variables because it is suitable to test the significant differences of three or more independent groups. Pearson's correlation, which is appropriate to reveal the nature and extent of associations between two variables [Stephen and Hornby 1997], was applied to find the correlations between attributes and the correlations between WA scores and the eight attributes. A significance level of p < 0.05 was adopted for the study. The mean value and standard deviation of each dependent variable are also presented in a table. 3.3.2 Clustering. K-means is one of the simplest clustering algorithms for grouping objects with similar features. In K-means, the number k of clusters is fixed before the algorithm runs. The algorithm randomly picks k cluster centers, assigns each point to the cluster whose mean is closest in a Euclidean distance sense, then computes the mean vectors of the points assigned to each cluster and uses these as new centers in an iterative approach [Hand et al. 2001]. In detail, the first step is to define k centroids (centers), one for each cluster. Another parameter called seed (S) is used to generate the random numbers for the assignment of the initial centroids. Following that, the algorithm takes each datapoint and associates it with the closest centroid. The next step starts when all the datapoints are assigned to clusters; it is the recalculation procedure of k new centroids. For these k new centroids, a new binding has to be done between the same dataset points and the closest new centroid. These two steps are alternated until a stopping criterion is met, that is, when there is no

further change in the assignment of the datapoints [Evgenia et al. 2004]. The outcome of the algorithm reveals the centroid or means vector of each cluster as well as statistics on the number and percentage of instances assigned to different clusters. Thus, centroids can be used to characterize the behavior of each of the formed clusters. One of the challenging issues in using the k-means algorithm for data clustering is that one needs to decide a suitable number of clusters, k, in advance. This prerequisite can be a drawback to other experiments and domains but not for this particular experiment. Since the dataset is not large, we ran the algorithm for k=2,. . . ,10. The other issue is that K-means is sensitive to how clusters are initially assigned; this can be overcome by trying different values for the seed number S and evaluate results in order to determine which combination fits the data better [Bandyopadhyay and Maulik 2002]. Another evaluation was needed to compare various combinations of the attributes that characterize each user. The goals of these evaluations were to minimize variability within clusters and maximize variability between clusters. In other words, the similarity rules will apply maximally to the members of one cluster and minimally to members belonging to the rest of the clusters. More specifically, the evaluations will emphasize how similar the behavior of a particular user is to user of the same cluster and how different the behavior of users in that clusters from the behavior of users of all other clusters. The results of the evaluations indicated that there were no significant differences among various attribute combinations and that the most efficient outcome was obtained with a value of k = 3 according to the mean values and standard deviations of attributes and the percentage of instances of each cluster. 3.3.3 Classification. Among data mining techniques, decision tree is one of the most frequently used methods for classification. A decision tree is used to discover rules and relationships by systematically subdividing the information contained in data [Chou 1991; Chen et al. 2003]. Typically, a decision tree algorithm begins with the entire set of data, splits the data into two or more subsets based on the values of one or more attributes, and then repeatedly splits each subset into finer subsets until the size of each subset reaches an appropriate level. The entire modeling process can be represented in a tree structure, and the model generated can be summarized as a set of "if­then" rules [Li 2005]. The value of the decision tree reflects its easy understanding and a simple top­down tree structure [Hsu et al. 2003]. In tree-structured representations, a set of data is represented by a node, and the entire data set is represented as a root node. When a split is made, several child nodes, which correspond to partitioned data subsets, are formed. If a node is not to be split any further, it is called a leaf; otherwise, it is an internal node. In this study, we deal with binary trees where each split produces exactly two child nodes. Some popular algorithms of decision trees are Classification & Regression Trees (C&RT) [Breiman et al. 1984], Chi-Squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) [Kass 1980], and C4.5 [Quinlan 1993]. In this study, we have used the C4.5 because it is a well-known classification algorithm and can

generate easily understandable rules [Ding et al. 2002]. The main goal of the algorithm is to discover relationships between a given classification of objects and a set of attributes. The output of the algorithm is a classification tree showing how objects may be assigned to the given classes on the basis of the values of these attributes [Andrienko and Andrienko 1999]. Tree production has three phases in this algorithm. In Phase I, an initial and large tree is created from the sets of examples according to attribute selection measures. In Phase II, an error-based pruning method is used to simplify the tree by discarding one or more sub-trees and replacing them with leaves or branches [Quinlan 1993]. In Phase III, the classification performance of the decision tree is tested by analyzing the number of correctly and incorrectly classified instances. The number of correctly classified instances determines whether the decision tree can be applied to the datasets or whether further preparation will be necessary. 4. RESULTS On the basis of Pearson's correlation, there is no significant negative relationship between the attributes. The frequency of using the hierarchical map and the number of pages browsed have a significant positive correlation (r=.304; p<0.05; N=65), followed by the frequency of using the examples and the number of repeated visits with a significant positive correlation (r=.260; p<0.05; N=65). However, these correlations are less than 0.5 so it seems unlikely that there is a possible replication of measures among the attributes that are positively correlated. Therefore, all attributes were considered in the aforementioned three-data analysis approaches. Section 4.1 described results obtained from traditional statistical tests (i.e., ANOVA and Pearson's correlations). The results of clustering (K-means algorithm) and classification (decision tree) are presented in Section 4.2 and Section 4.3, respectively. Section 4.4 discusses the similarities and differences of the results gained from these three approaches. 4.1 Traditional Statistics To identify the statistical significance, an ANOVA was conducted to compare the differences among three cognitive style groups for each attribute (Table IV). In addition, Pearson's correlation was used to find whether there was a significant relationship between the WA score and each attribute (Table V). The results appeared to be consistent. Five attributes were found to be significant in both analyses: the frequencies of looking at examples and details and the frequencies of using main menu, hierarchical maps, and alphabetical index. No significant differences were found in these two analyses for two attributes, that is, the frequency of using overview and the number of repeated visits. However, the number of pages browsed was significant in Pearson's correlations, but there was no significance based on the analysis with ANOVA.

A possible explanation for this inconsistency is that three intermediate students had WA scores near a border with field-dependent students, with whom they might share some similar learning patterns. Post-hoc analysis of mean differences using the Tukey test showed significance differences for the frequencies of using the hierarchical map and the main menu between field-dependent students and field-independent (p<0.01) or intermediate students (p<0.05) but not between field-independent and intermediate students (p>0.05). Tukey test analyses also revealed that fieldindependent students significantly chose the alphabetical index and examined the details many more times than field-dependent (p<0.01) and intermediate students (p<0.01) but there were no significant differences between fielddependent and intermediate students (p>0.05). Table VI presents the mean and standard deviation of the frequency of each attribute for each cognitive style group. 4.2 Clustering The purpose of clustering is to group learners based on their similar learning patterns. Based on this rationale, three clusters were produced. The percentage of learners within each cluster is satisfactory for the total number of 65 instances. Clusters can be characterized as well balanced: Cluster 0 (N = 22): 34%, Cluster 1 (N= 23): 35%, Cluster 2 (N = 20): 31%. The mean value and standard deviation of each attribute for each cluster are shown in Table VII, where learners are grouped according to the following trends. --Cluster 0 (C0). Learners visited few pages, made few repeated visits and seldom accessed any navigation tools and subject categories. --Cluster 1 (C1). Learners visited some pages, made some repeated visits, frequently accessed the alphabetical index, and looked at the detailed descriptions. --Cluster 2 (C2). Learners visited many pages, made many repeated visits, frequently accessed the hierarchical map and looked at the examples. When analyzing the WA Score of each cluster, we found that there is a significant difference (F (2, 62)=5.878; p<0.01). Cluster 1 has the highest WA score (Mean=1.4; Standard Deviation=0.38), while Cluster 2 has the lowest WA score (Mean=1.0; Standard Deviation=0.24). In other words, the learners of

Fig. 3. Cognitive styles in three clusters.

Cluster 1 have a field-independent tendency, whereas the learners of Cluster 2 have a field-dependent tendency. These results seem consistent with the distribution of cognitive styles among the three clusters (Figure 3). Fieldindependent learners (N=14; 56%) mainly emerge in Cluster 1 in which the learners frequently examined the detailed descriptions, accessed the alphabetical index many more times, and browsed fewer pages. Conversely, the majority of field-dependent learners (N=12; 57%) appear in Cluster 2 in which learners often accessed the hierarchical map, browsed many more pages, and favored learning from examples. Unlike field-independent and field-dependent learners, intermediate learners of each cluster are almost balanced (Cluster 0: N=7, 36%; Cluster 1: N=6, 32%; Cluster 2: N=6, 32%). To identify whether cognitive style was the only one human factor that directed students' learning patterns, the significant differences of other human factors among the three clusters were also examined. None of them are significant, including their previous experience using computers (F (3, 61)=2.008; p>0.05), the Internet (F (3, 61)=0.126; p>0.05), and computer-aided learning (F (4, 60)=2.685; p>0.05). 4.3 Classification Figure 4 shows the decision tree that was generated for characterizing cognitive styles. According to this decision tree, the frequencies of using the examples and the hierarchical maps are the most important and second most important features to classify the cognitive styles, respectively. On the third level, the frequency of using the alphabetical index and the number of pages browsed are also relevant. As shown in this decision tree, the examples were mainly chosen by field-dependent students, and this result is coherent with those from clustering and traditional statistics. It is worth noting that the hierarchical map and alphabetical index could have been used by both fielddependent and field-independent students but they used these navigation tools in different ways. Field-dependent students, who either frequently used the hierarchical map or frequently used the alphabetical index, browsed many more

pages. Conversely, field-independent students, who frequently used the hierarchical map, visited fewer pages. Field-independent students, who rarely used the hierarchical map and the alphabetical index, looked at the detailed descriptions many more times. In other words, such detailed description may be the major source for their learning. These learning patterns are not derived from traditional statistical and clustering approaches. In addition to illustrating the students' learning patterns, the decision tree can also be converted to create rules for the predictions of the students' cognitive styles, that is, identifying the cognitive styles of new students based on their learning patterns. In total, there are eight rules drawn from the decision tree. Different rules lead to different cognitive styles. The first rule obtained from the right side of the second level of the tree indicates that students who visit the examples more than 11 times are classified field-dependent students. The second rule taken from the right side of the fourth level shows that students who use the map more than 10 times and browse less than or equal to 57 pages are classified as field-independent students. The remaining rules were acquired from the bottom level of the tree. The third to the sixth rules were gained from the left side, while the seventh and eighth rules were from the right side. In terms of the former, the third rule is that students who use the map less than or equal to 10 times and use the index less than or equal to 9 times and visit the detailed descriptions less than or equal to 12 times are classified as intermediate students. The fourth rule is that students who use the map less than or equal to 10 times and use the index less than or equal to 9 times and visit the detailed descriptions more than 12 times are classified as field-independent students. The fifth rule is that students who use the map less than or equal to 10 times and use the index more than 9 times and browse less than or equal to 45 pages are classified as intermediate students. The sixth rule is that students who use the map less than or equal to 10 times and use the index more than 9 times and browse more than 45 pages are classified as field-dependent students. The seventh rule is that students who use the map more than 10 times and browse more than 57 pages and use the main

menu less than or equal to 6 times are classified as intermediate students. The eighth rule is that students who use the map more than 10 times and browse more than 57 pages and use the menu more than 6 times are classified as field-dependent students. As shown in these eight rules, a cognitive style could be reached by more than one rule. In this case, three rules are connected with field-dependent students, three are associated with intermediate students, and the other two are related to field-independent students. These rules can be applied to replace the CSA or other cognitive style tests and work as criteria for automatic identification of the students' cognitive styles. In other words, the students' cognitive styles can be automatically recognized based on their learning patterns which can contribute to the development of personalized learning environments on the Web. 4.4 Summary Regarding whether these attributes are related to cognitive styles, the results obtained from the four data analysis approaches are rather similar (Table VIII). The common relevant attributes are the frequencies of looking at examples and details and frequencies of using the main menu, hierarchical maps, and alphabetical index. The common irrelevant attributes are the frequencies of looking at the overview and the number of repeated visits. The number of pages browsed is recognized as a critical attribute based on the results obtained from the K-means algorithm, the decision tree, and the Pearson's correlations, but the results from ANOVA indicate that there is no statistical significance. 5. DISCUSSIONS As shown in the previous section, cognitive style has significant effects on student learning patterns in the WBI program. In particular, they have different preferences in the selection of navigation tools and display options. The difference in their preferences may be a reflection of differences in the students' cognitive styles [Wildemuth et al. 1998]. For example, intermediate learners of each cluster are almost balanced. It suggests that they are equally comfortable using each learning pattern. One possible interpretation is that individuals possessing an intermediate cognitive style combine the characteristics of both field independence and field dependence and employ a more versatile repertoire of learning strategies. Versatile learners, who have acquired the skill to move back and forth between different learning strategies, are more capable of adapting themselves to the learning systems [Ford 2000]. In addition, the different learning patterns showed by field-independent and field-dependent learners also echo their characteristics which are discussed in the following. 5.1 Analytical vs. Global A major issue in identifying differences between field-independent and fielddependent students is their separate tendencies to adopt analytical and global approaches. This difference may explain the results of this study that field-independent students tend to browse fewer pages than field-dependent

students. A possible interpretation of this finding is that field-independent students tend to be more analytical [Ford et al. 1994] and they are very task oriented [Witkin et al. 1977]. Hence, they only pay attention to particular topics related to their learning, and thus browse fewer pages. On the contrary, field-dependent students perceive objects as a whole and process information in a global fashion [Goodenough 1976]. Therefore, they tend to browse many more pages to build an overall picture of the subject content. Such findings strengthen the claim of previous research that field-independent people are good at analytical thought, whereas field-dependent people have global perceptions [Witkin et al. 1977]. 5.2 Active vs. Passive In this study, field-dependent and field-independent students show different preferences for navigation tools. Field-independent students often access the alphabetical index, which provides users with means to locate particular information without going through a fixed sequence [Chen and Macredie 2002]. This may be due to the fact that field-independent students actively segment information into relevant parts [Goodenough 1976]. Conversely, fielddependent students often use the hierarchical map, which applies a graphical representation to illustrate the relationships among different concepts [Turns et al. 2000] and reflects the conceptual structure of the subject content [Nilsson and Mayer 2002]. This might be caused by the fact that fielddependent students tend to take a passive approach by relying on salient cues [Anastasi 1988], and they have more difficulties in separating the individual parts within a whole [Witkin et al. 1977]. With the extra guidance provided by the hierarchical map, field-dependent students can more easily access meaningful information. The findings, in general, support previous studies [Evans and Edwards 1999; Hsu and Schwen 2003]. 5.3 Internal vs. External The results of our study have shown that different cognitive style groups tend to favor different display options. Field-dependent students often look at examples, while field-independent students frequently examine the detailed descriptions. Examples are down-to-earth visual material that provides illustrations with practical cases to be helpful to students in deepening their understandings. This approach is beneficial to field-dependent individuals who rely more on external frames of reference and operate best when analyses are already provided [Lyons-Lawrence 1994]. The detailed descriptions presents text-based explanations of theoretical concepts which are very detailed, but they do not illustrate the concepts with practical cases. Therefore, there is a lack of concrete guidance for students; students need to transfer their knowledge into an activity by themselves. This may not interfere with field-independent students who use an internal frame of reference to organize information [Reiff 1996] and structure problems [Davis and Cochran 1989]. Therefore, they are more able to reorganize information from the detailed descriptions and create useful cues on their own. This finding is in accordance

with that of previous work that field-independent individuals have more theoretical and abstract interests [Miller and Escolme 1990].

6. IMPLICATIONS FOR SYSTEM DESIGN The previous discussion suggests that student learning patterns are significantly influenced by their cognitive styles. Field-independent and fielddependent learners have different characteristics that affect their learning patterns. This implies that WBI programs should be developed to support the unique needs of each cognitive style group. More specifically, the WBI programs should be flexible enough to offer multiple options tailored to the distinctive cognitive styles. To this end, a model (Figure 5), which was developed using the results presented in Section 4, can be considered as a mechanism to help designers develop WBI programs that can accommodate the preferences of both field-independent and field-dependent learners. The core of the model consists of three key design elements of WBI programs: navigation tools, display options, and content scope.

6.1 Navigation Tools In this study, field-independent students tend to actively group relevant concepts from the alphabetical index by themselves, while field-dependent students tend to be passive and rely on the hierarchical map to build the relationships among different concepts. One of the solutions to accommodate their different preferences is to allow the learners to see both navigation tools at the same time by using frames. Frame uses an underlying grid layout which allows multiple documents to be shown in a window at once [Milunovich 2002]. Navigation control is one of the benefits of using frames. One frame can always stay visible even if the contents of the other frame change [Hobbs 1999]. In this case, there are two frames: the hierarchical map frame and the alphabetical index frame. The hierarchical map frame is always visible and it corresponds to information selected from the alphabetical index frame. In other words, the selected topic in the alphabetical index frame would be highlighted in the hierarchical map frame. In doing so, field-independent students can use the alphabetical index frame to select a relevant topic and field-dependent students can identify the relationships between this topic and other topics from the hierarchical map frame. 6.2 Display Options The results of our study have shown that field-independent students are capable of extracting relevant information from the detailed description which lacks practical instruction because they have a tendency to use their own internal references. On the other hand, field-dependent students rely more heavily on external cues, thus, they prefer to get concrete guidance from examples. One of the possible ways to address their different needs is to show both of the display options, detailed description and concrete examples, within a table. By using a table, all of the relevant information about a particular case can gathered together in one place. For example, one column can be used to present the detailed descriptions of a particular topic, while the other column provides the illustration with examples for that topic. This approach not only lets field-independent students have a look at detailed descriptions, but also provides field-dependent students with concrete examples. In other words, the information needs of both cognitive style groups can be met simultaneously. 6.3 Content Scope Field-independent students approach an environment in an analytical fashion so they tend to focus on information that is relevant to their tasks. Hence, they browse fewer pages to directly get to relevant topics for completing their tasks. Conversely, field-dependent students use a global approach to process information so they tend to build an overall picture by browsing more pages. One of the potential solutions to deal with their different requirements is to use a pop-up window, which is a secondary window to provide additional information about selected objects by clicking a hypertext link [Bell et al. 2002]. In this case, a pop-up window can be used to show additional topics for field-dependent students who would like to get a global picture of the subject content. However,

these windows can be switched off, lest they irritate field-independent students who have a tendency to focus on specific relevant topics. In other words, information that is related to tasks is put in the main window for field-independent students, while unrelated information is displayed with a pop-up window for field-dependent students. 7. CONCLUSIONS WBI creates learning opportunities for everyone if suitable considerations are made in the design process. Otherwise, they can impose needless barriers to equal participation in educational settings. The experimental results obtained in this study suggest that cognitive style plays an influential role in student learning patterns within WBI. Field-independent and field-dependent learners have different preferences for locating information, especially for the selection of navigation tools and display options. Thus, there is a need to be aware of cognitive styles when planning to improve the usability and functionality of WBI programs. The contribution of this study includes three aspects: theory, methodology, and applications. In terms of theory, this study deepens the understanding of the importance of cognitive styles in the development of WBI programs by providing empirical evidence. Cognitive styles, gender differences, and system experience are factors that are frequently considered in the literature of individual differences but it is inconclusive as to their relative importance. The findings of this study indicated that cognitive style is a major factor that influences student learning patterns. However, it was only one relatively small study. Further work needs to be undertaken with a larger sample to provide additional evidence. With regard to methodology, this study analyzed the experimental data with a data mining approach, which used both clustering and classification techniques. These two techniques are complementary in that they integrate the analysis of macro and micro levels. The results from clustering present an overall picture of the students' learning patterns, whereas those from classification provide the detailed rules for the automatic identification of students' cognitive styles based on their learning patterns. However, this study only used two methods, that is, K-means (clustering) and decision trees (classification). Given any dataset, there are often no strict rules that impose the use of a specific method over another in its analysis. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct further work to analyze student learning patterns using other clustering or classification methods, for examples self-organizing maps and support vector machines. It would be interesting to see whether similar results can be found by using these methods. As far as the application is concerned, this study recognized the importance of versatility in the development of WBI programs and developed a model to illustrate the needs of different cognitive styles. In addition, several design approaches were proposed to accommodate the preferences of both fieldindependent and field-dependent learners. In the future, the rationale of the model and the design approaches can be used to improve the development of existing WBI programs and other Web-based applications such as digital

libraries, search engines, and electronic journals. Finally, it would be valuable to see whether such WBI programs and the Web-based applications can promote learners' performance and increase their satisfaction.
