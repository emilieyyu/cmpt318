history
prehistoric
man
in
asia
minor
now
modern
turkey
or
greece
could
look
out
across
the
aegean
toward
the
horizon
and
see
the
faint
silhouette
of
land
their
curiosity
pushed
them
to
build
vessels
that
were
strong
enough
to
ford
the
open
seas
and
reach
these
islands
marking
the
start
of
the
long
legacy
of
mediterranean
seafaring
around
7000
b
c
the
phoenicians
set
out
from
what
is
now
iran
to
explore
their
surroundings
they
eventually
reached
the
islands
and
founded
colonies
on
the
islands
in
the
northernmost
part
of
the
aegean
sea
an
important
early
material
obsidian
was
discovered
on
the
island
of
milos
obsidian
is
a
hard
vitreous
volcanic
rock
which
could
be
fashioned
into
tools
for
cutting
and
stabbing
the
high
quality
of
the
seam
on
milos
ensured
that
the
area
remained
popular
with
early
travelers
the
basic
elements
of
life
in
the
aegean
began
to
come
together
as
early
as
5000
b
c
and
were
already
in
place
by
the
late
bronze
age
c
2700
b
c
the
major
changes
were
not
to
daily
tasks
and
routines
but
to
the
political
power
base
which
changed
regularly
and
not
necessarily
peacefully
throughout
the
ages
cycladic
culture
at
around
3500
b
c
a
sophisticated
culture
evolved
in
the
cyclades
islands
the
distinctive
sculpted
marble
figures
of
the
era
are
now
being
reproduced
in
vast
quantities
as
souvenirs
you
will
find
original
examples
in
the
archaeological
museums
throughout
the
cyclades
although
one
of
the
earliest
examples
is
in
the
museum
on
paros
the
people
farmed
and
fished
on
the
dawning
of
the
bronze
age
in
2700
b
c
they
began
to
work
with
metals
the
cycladic
culture
was
influenced
by
societies
in
the
east
importing
the
pottery
wheel
from
mesopotamia
they
also
continued
to
trade
in
obsidian
and
the
local
marble
the
minoans
and
the
myceneans
farther
south
in
crete
the
minoan
culture
developed
after
2000
b
c
into
the
most
significant
of
its
age
spreading
its
influence
throughout
the
region
by
trade
and
diplomacy
santorini
thira
the
next
major
island
north
was
heavily
influenced
by
crete
and
the
settlements
of
thira
and
akrotiri
thrived
at
this
time
the
magnificent
frescoes
and
mosaics
found
at
akrotiri
are
in
athens
at
present
but
the
remains
of
the
buildings
at
the
site
provide
ample
evidence
of
the
sophistication
of
the
culture
here
around
1500
b
c
a
massive
volcanic
eruption
at
santorini
destroyed
not
only
akrotiri
under
feet
of
ash
and
pumice
but
the
whole
minoan
civilization
massive
tidal
waves
swept
over
crete
and
other
parts
of
the
mediterranean
smashing
buildings
and
drowning
many
thousands
of
people
in
the
wake
of
this
tremendous
natural
upheaval
the
aegean
islands
next
came
under
the
influence
of
the
mycenaeans
at
around
1300
b
c
who
had
a
base
in
the
peloponnese
region
of
the
greek
mainland
the
mycenaeans
were
an
acquisitive
race
who
came
to
conquer
not
to
trade
their
extensive
military
campaigns
were
later
chronicled
by
homer
in
his
epic
poems
the
odyssey
and
the
iliad
the
rise
of
athens
the
dorians
who
came
overland
from
northern
europe
conquered
the
mycenaeans
they
were
a
barbaric
race
and
their
custody
of
the
area
brought
about
a
dark
period
during
which
the
written
word
was
forgotten
and
art
disappeared
they
held
sway
over
islands
off
the
northern
greek
coast
but
the
phoenicians
kept
control
of
the
main
sea
routes
south
of
the
area
trade
continued
as
usual
at
the
same
time
city
states
began
to
grow
in
influence
on
the
southern
greek
mainland
athens
became
the
most
powerful
heralding
the
start
of
the
classical
greek
period
however
greece
was
not
yet
a
country
each
city
state
was
self
governing
and
autonomous
the
new
culture
spread
throughout
the
mediterranean
helped
by
a
huge
increase
in
migration
from
the
mainland
to
new
settlements
such
as
carthage
a
greek
city
on
the
african
coast
of
the
mediterranean
culture
and
the
arts
flourished
once
again
athletic
prowess
was
admired
and
the
olympic
games
were
constituted
in
776
b
c
to
promote
friendly
competition
homer
wrote
his
epic
works
on
chios
and
lyrical
poetry
was
much
admired
particularly
the
work
of
the
poets
archilochos
on
paros
and
sappho
on
lesvos
the
preeminent
islands
of
this
era
were
delos
a
sacred
island
and
center
of
religion
ruled
by
athens
samos
ruled
by
the
tyrant
polycrates
and
naxos
whose
ruler
lygdamis
undertook
some
major
building
projects
archaeology
shows
that
during
this
time
societies
lived
mainly
in
coastal
trading
towns
with
little
settlement
inland
the
persian
wars
as
athens
rose
in
influence
and
power
in
the
west
it
was
matched
in
the
east
by
the
rise
of
the
persian
empire
from
a
power
base
in
anatolia
the
persians
overran
the
eastern
aegean
islands
and
set
their
sights
on
the
cyclades
in
490
b
c
they
captured
sacred
delos
and
razed
the
settlements
on
naxos
the
island
communities
were
undecided
about
which
side
to
back
for
a
time
paros
and
andros
contributed
to
the
persian
armory
while
others
supported
athens
the
two
superpowers
finally
clashed
at
the
epic
battles
of
marathon
and
salamis
in
480
b
c
the
persians
were
defeated
and
athens
duly
punished
the
islands
that
had
turned
against
it
following
its
victory
athens
introduced
the
concept
of
a
mutual
protection
alliance
a
kind
of
nato
of
the
ancient
world
several
islands
and
greek
city
states
agreed
to
work
together
and
created
a
treasury
to
fund
their
plans
which
was
held
on
the
island
of
delos
the
alliance
became
known
as
the
delian
league
although
there
were
minor
internal
wrangles
the
league
controlled
the
aegean
and
the
greater
athenian
empire
for
most
of
the
fifth
century
b
c
later
in
454
b
c
the
treasury
was
transferred
to
athens
and
its
deposits
were
used
to
finance
the
construction
of
many
of
the
major
buildings
and
temples
of
the
classical
age
in
431
b
c
athens
began
a
war
with
its
neighbor
and
league
member
sparta
although
the
islands
saw
little
action
as
the
war
went
on
they
could
see
that
athens
was
slowly
losing
its
power
before
the
end
of
the
war
in
401
b
c
many
islands
had
already
transferred
their
allegiance
to
the
victors
who
were
led
by
philip
ii
of
macedon
he
was
followed
in
336
b
c
by
his
son
alexander
the
great
one
of
the
most
remarkable
leaders
in
history
his
rise
to
power
ushered
in
the
hellenistic
period
hellenistic
and
roman
periods
when
alexander
went
on
to
conquer
lands
as
far
to
the
east
as
india
the
aegean
became
a
crossroads
for
the
long
trading
routes
delos
became
one
of
the
largest
marketplaces
in
the
empire
following
alexander
s
death
his
lands
were
divided
among
his
generals
much
of
the
aegean
came
under
the
rule
of
the
ptolemies
along
with
egypt
cleopatra
was
a
member
of
this
famous
ruling
clan
although
in
88
b
c
mithradates
made
a
swift
and
successful
raid
from
the
east
across
asia
minor
and
the
aegean
islands
the
next
major
power
change
brought
influence
from
the
west
the
greek
hellenistic
empire
was
gradually
and
peacefully
absorbed
into
the
roman
empire
the
byzantine
empire
and
the
coming
of
christianity
the
romans
ruled
a
pagan
empire
but
the
aegean
had
an
important
influence
on
the
early
development
of
christianity
in
a
d
95
st
john
arrived
on
patmos
a
small
rocky
island
in
the
dodecanese
as
a
political
prisoner
it
was
here
that
he
wrote
what
was
to
become
the
final
book
of
the
new
testament
the
book
of
revelation
it
wasn
t
until
a
d
330
however
when
the
newly
converted
emperor
constantine
made
byzantium
renamed
constantinople
capital
of
his
eastern
empire
that
christianity
was
assured
of
its
dominant
role
in
future
greek
life
the
byzantine
empire
had
powerful
and
well
fortified
cities
but
the
countryside
and
the
outlying
islands
were
ravaged
by
waves
of
invaders
in
an
attempt
to
counter
a
threat
from
the
saracen
muslims
a
new
potent
religious
force
from
the
east
the
byzantine
army
forcefully
enlisted
the
men
of
the
islands
disease
took
a
further
toll
by
the
time
of
the
crusades
many
of
the
aegean
islands
had
been
practically
depopulated
as
the
byzantine
empire
weakened
at
the
end
of
the
first
millennium
crusader
forces
were
sent
from
western
europe
to
counter
the
muslim
forces
and
retake
jerusalem
for
the
christian
faith
unfortunately
their
zeal
was
not
matched
by
their
discrimination
the
crusaders
swept
through
the
land
of
byzantium
slaughtering
christians
as
well
as
muslims
civilians
as
well
as
soldiers
constantinople
was
taken
by
crusader
forces
in
1204
and
they
stripped
the
city
of
many
of
its
finest
treasures
which
now
grace
the
public
buildings
of
venice
although
a
large
consignment
of
books
and
manuscripts
was
transferred
to
the
monastery
at
patmos
before
the
city
fell
while
byzantine
land
was
being
divided
there
was
no
one
in
control
of
the
seas
so
pirates
raided
towns
on
many
of
the
islands
to
counter
this
the
populations
moved
from
their
homes
on
the
coast
and
built
settlements
inland
out
of
sight
of
the
raiding
parties
this
created
a
pattern
seen
today
throughout
the
aegean
of
a
small
port
skala
which
serves
an
inland
settlement
or
chora
making
it
easier
to
protect
the
island
from
attack
the
minor
aegean
islands
were
taken
by
various
powerful
european
noblemen
many
of
whom
were
genoese
or
venetian
such
as
marco
sanudo
on
naxos
the
noblemen
had
free
rein
to
create
their
own
fiefdoms
the
venetians
fortified
their
main
towns
naxos
town
and
antiparos
town
are
wonderful
examples
of
this
creating
labyrinths
of
narrow
alleys
and
cul
de
sacs
that
were
designed
to
confuse
and
to
demoralize
invaders
the
genoese
took
control
of
the
eastern
aegean
islands
which
were
considered
the
most
valuable
for
agriculture
and
trade
after
a
final
bloody
defeat
by
the
muslims
in
1309
christian
forces
were
forced
from
the
holy
land
the
knights
of
st
john
a
holy
military
force
made
their
way
to
rhodes
and
kos
in
the
dodecanese
they
began
the
process
of
building
their
strong
citadels
and
reinforcing
the
christian
faith
on
the
islands
however
they
had
not
seen
the
last
of
their
muslim
foe
a
force
was
gaining
strength
in
the
east
to
threaten
their
new
bases
the
coming
of
the
ottoman
turks
the
ottomans
were
roving
invaders
who
came
from
the
east
taking
land
in
what
is
now
turkey
by
the
end
of
the
13th
century
they
began
their
first
raids
on
the
aegean
islands
in
1453
they
took
constantinople
and
immediately
made
it
their
capital
renaming
it
istanbul
they
then
set
their
sights
on
the
islands
of
the
knights
of
st
john
and
after
an
unsuccessful
siege
in
1480
they
finally
ejected
the
knights
from
the
dodecanese
in
1522
in
1566
they
wrested
chios
from
the
genoese
bolstering
their
hold
on
the
eastern
aegean
islands
but
the
cyclades
remained
in
venetian
hands
for
another
generation
or
more
tinos
was
the
last
to
fall
in
1715
the
ottomans
brought
new
influences
to
the
islands
that
they
controlled
forming
a
large
empire
that
stretched
around
the
eastern
mediterranean
toward
greek
independence
however
a
movement
was
growing
on
the
greek
peninsula
against
ottoman
rule
and
for
an
independent
greek
state
in
1770
russia
came
to
aid
the
greeks
defined
by
their
orthodox
religion
rather
than
by
historical
geographical
boundaries
declaring
war
on
the
ottoman
empire
and
occupying
several
aegean
islands
until
1774
graffiti
written
by
russian
soldiers
can
be
seen
in
the
caves
of
antiparos
although
this
attempt
was
unsuccessful
the
campaign
for
a
greek
state
continued
into
the
19th
century
and
began
to
grow
in
strength
the
aegean
islands
played
their
part
lesvos
chios
and
samos
lay
in
the
important
shipping
lanes
and
patriots
began
disrupting
ottoman
cargo
traffic
in
return
the
turks
violently
put
down
every
insurrection
including
the
massacre
on
chios
when
22
000
people
were
slaughtered
the
ottoman
empire
was
weakening
however
and
in
1821
the
peoples
of
the
greek
mainland
achieved
nationhood
for
the
first
time
the
cyclades
and
the
sporades
island
chains
were
also
included
in
this
new
state
a
new
sense
of
identity
enveloped
greek
peoples
throughout
the
aegean
thus
commencing
a
movement
to
expand
greece
and
unify
the
disparate
orthodox
populations
the
twentieth
century
a
series
of
disastrous
decisions
at
the
beginning
of
the
20th
century
began
to
sound
a
death
knell
for
the
ottoman
empire
the
turks
lost
a
short
war
with
italy
and
were
forced
to
relinquish
the
dodecanese
islands
to
the
italians
greece
took
this
opportunity
to
absorb
the
islands
of
the
northern
and
eastern
aegean
and
to
add
macedonia
to
its
mainland
territories
following
this
debacle
the
ottomans
then
allied
themselves
to
germany
in
the
world
war
i
losing
more
territory
with
the
defeat
of
the
germans
in
that
war
greece
was
handed
a
strip
of
land
along
the
western
coast
of
asia
minor
which
for
over
2
000
years
had
had
a
substantial
greek
population
greece
moved
in
to
administer
the
land
but
a
new
influence
upset
any
grand
dreams
of
making
this
region
a
part
of
greater
greece
in
1923
turkey
broke
away
from
the
tired
ottoman
rulers
and
kemal
ataturk
rose
to
power
on
a
wave
of
popular
support
he
promised
a
modern
state
for
his
people
but
as
the
situation
became
volatile
civil
strife
broke
out
in
turkish
cities
and
those
considered
greek
were
victims
of
threats
and
violence
many
had
to
leave
their
birthplaces
fleeing
to
lesvos
chios
and
samos
the
greek
ruled
islands
just
offshore
thousands
of
people
arrived
with
little
more
than
the
clothes
they
wore
putting
great
strain
on
the
resources
of
the
islands
finally
greece
was
ousted
from
its
new
territory
in
asia
minor
which
became
part
of
the
new
turkish
state
greece
attempted
to
stay
out
of
world
war
ii
but
mussolini
saw
greece
as
an
ideal
addition
to
his
italian
empire
his
forces
made
a
series
of
attacks
from
their
bases
in
the
dodecanese
islands
including
sinking
a
greek
naval
vessel
in
the
harbor
of
tinos
town
but
they
only
succeeded
in
strengthening
the
resolve
of
the
population
against
them
later
the
germans
came
in
force
and
occupied
many
of
the
islands
after
the
war
in
1949
the
dodecanese
islands
finally
became
part
of
the
greek
nation
but
the
country
was
politically
fragmented
with
arguments
between
monarchists
and
republicans
right
and
left
and
tension
escalated
into
civil
war
the
struggle
bypassed
most
of
the
islands
although
there
was
fierce
fighting
on
samos
even
after
the
fighting
stopped
more
than
a
decade
later
the
country
was
not
stable
at
the
same
time
the
massive
growth
in
air
and
road
transport
saw
shipping
decline
in
importance
the
aegean
islands
which
for
centuries
had
been
important
ports
on
the
trading
routes
became
the
backwaters
of
this
new
transport
network
and
the
economies
of
several
islands
came
close
to
collapse
in
1967
the
military
took
the
reins
of
power
in
athens
and
until
1974
the
colonels
held
sway
with
a
repressive
and
brutal
regime
many
greek
islanders
chose
to
leave
rather
than
live
in
poverty
and
terror
and
many
made
new
homes
in
the
united
states
and
australia
the
expansion
of
air
travel
began
the
age
of
mass
tourism
and
greece
along
with
the
aegean
islands
became
exciting
destinations
for
northern
europeans
escaping
their
damp
cool
summers
in
1982
greece
joined
the
european
common
market
now
the
european
union
since
this
time
membership
has
been
of
great
monetary
benefit
to
the
country
the
eu
has
given
large
subsidies
to
develop
greece
s
infrastructure
and
grants
to
excavate

4
000
years

had
been

here
for
centuries
probably
millennia
before

at

b

jerusalem
was
a

on

far
less
important

biblical
cities
such
as

the

hebrew
and

shalom

if
true
this
is
an
ironic
name
for

that
would

captured

from

in

1000
b

the

be
the

tunnel
infiltrated
by
david
s
army
perhaps
because
jerusalem
was
in
neutral
territory
not
allotted
to
any
of
the
twelve
rival
tribes
of
israel
david
made
it
the
capital
of
his
newly
formed
kingdom
and
brought
the
most
talented
artisans
dedicated
priests
magical
poets
and
musicians
and
the
most
formidable
soldiers
from
each
of
the
tribes
to
live
in

also
brought
the

the

the
tablets
of
the
law
received
on

to
the
spring

just
outside

there
the

rested
until
it
was
placed

the

the

today
known
as
the

was
completed
by
david
s
son

successor
king
solomon
according
to
biblical
tradition
although
david
bought
the
land
for
the
temple
and
carefully
assembled
its
building
materials
he
was
deemed
unworthy
of
constructing
the
temple
because
he
was
a
man
of

the
beauties

glories
of

under

have
captivated
readers
of
the
bible
for
almost
3
000
years
but
with
his
death
the
empire
collapsed
and
the
israelite
kingdom
was
divided
into
two
separate
impoverished
often
warring
nations
israel
with
its
capital
at
shechem
in

north
ruled
by
a
series
of
northern
dynasties
and
the
smaller
kingdom
of
judah
with
its
capital
at
jerusalem
from
which
the
davidic
dynasty
continued
to
rule
the
bible
tells
us
that
the
cruelty
and
impiety
of
the
rulers
of
both
kingdoms
aroused
the
fury
of
the
great
prophets
in
701
b

the
assyrian
armies

destroyed
israel
and

the

to
lay
siege
to
jerusalem
when
it
fell
the
temple

all
the

the
people

forced
into
an
exile
known
as

was
overthrown

the
israelites
were

to
return

the
city
was
now
under

a
brief
history
early
habitation
the
inhabited
history
of
the
las
vegas
valley
stretches
to
23
000
b
c
when
much
of
the
area
was
covered
by
a
prehistoric
lake
during
this
period
the
indigenous
people
lived
in
caves
hunting
the
mammals
that
gathered
at
the
shoreline
the
landscape
of
the
valley
changed
dramatically
over
the
next
200
centuries
the
glaciers
feeding
the
lake
melted
away
and
the
lake
evaporated
fossils
tell
an
obscure
story
of
man
s
slow
and
sporadic
development
around
3000
b
c
native
archaic
indians
began
to
develop
a
lasting
hunting
and
gathering
culture
by
this
time
the
valley
was
in
much
the
same
geographic
state
as
it
exists
in
today
with
one
exception
the
presence
of
artesian
springs
that
bubbled
to
the
surface
in
several
areas
these
springs
fed
a
network
of
streams
draining
through
the
las
vegas
wash
to
the
colorado
river
the
areas
surrounding
the
springs
were
desert
oases
sprawling
collections
of
grasses
trees
and
wildlife
many
springs
lay
in
areas
that
would
eventually
become
the
center
of
the
modern
las
vegas
metropolis
for
about
4000
years
the
archaics
thrived
in
a
culture
that
included
many
signs
of
early
civilization
signs
of
even
more
advancement
appeared
halfway
through
the
first
millennium
a
d
when
the
anasazi
indians
inhabited
the
valley
far
more
progressive
than
the
archaics
the
anasazi
utilized
such
formal
agricultural
techniques
as
irrigation
to
assist
their
harvest
this
permitted
the
anasazi
to
achieve
a
benchmark
of
advanced
society
the
ability
to
live
in
permanent
shelters
year
round
without
need
to
follow
wildlife
mysteriously
the
anasazi
vanished
from
the
valley
around
a
d
1150
leaving
it
to
be
repopulated
by
the
southern
paiutes
another
hunter
gatherer
tribe
unable
to
replicate
the
agricultural
techniques
of
the
anasazi
the
paiutes
were
destined
to
a
semi
nomadic
lifestyle
until
european
settlers
arrived
changing
the
nature
of
existence
in
the
valley
forever
from
mailmen
to
mormons
in
the
early
nineteenth
century
america
s
western
territories
were
still
largely
unexplored
it
was
not
until
1829
that
rafael
rivera
a
mexican
scout
found
a
spring
fed
valley
and
dubbed
it
las
vegas
a
spanish
name
that
leaves
many
modern
visitors
wondering
exactly
where
the
meadows
really
lay
for
fifteen
years
las
vegas
was
used
as
a
spanish
trail
way
station
in
1844
american
explorer
john
c
fremont
parked
his
horses
at
big
springs
and
his
report
to
the
government
resulted
in
a
mail
route
leading
past
the
spot
on
its
way
to
california
this
put
las
vegas
on
the
map
and
was
one
of
the
crucial
turning
points
of
its
history
in
1855
mormon
leader
brigham
young
responded
to
promising
reports
of
las
vegas
by
sending
30
missionary
settlers
to
the
valley
they
eventually
built
a
fort
not
far
from
today
s
downtown
surrounded
by
acres
of
farmland
hewn
from
the
hard
desert
the
adobe
fort
became
a
focal
point
for
the
development
of
las
vegas
for
the
next
fifty
years
the
missionaries
struggled
valiantly
against
the
dictates
of
the
desert
trying
simultaneously
to
survive
the
harshness
of
their
circumstances
and
spread
the
mormon
faith
additional
pressures
from
arriving
miners
pushed
the
missionaries
plight
beyond
recovery
their
supplies
scarce
their
harvest
meager
and
their
spirit
broken
they
abandoned
the
fort
in
1858
despite
the
fact
that
the
local
land
was
rich
in
silver
by
1865
most
of
the
mining
traffic
through
las
vegas
was
of
prospectors
headed
to
california
or
northern
nevada
in
search
of
gold
one
opportunist
who
stayed
was
octavius
decatur
gass
bestowed
with
plenty
of
the
invaluable
pioneer
spirit
that
characterizes
las
vegas
to
this
day
gass
redirected
his
life
by
picking
up
where
the
mormons
left
off
at
least
when
it
came
to
ranching
and
farming
gass
took
over
the
abandoned
mormon
fort
and
640
acres
260
hectares
surrounding
it
dubbing
it
the
las
vegas
ranch
he
expanded
the
ranch
and
irrigated
the
land
so
that
it
would
support
crops
and
cattle
his
determination
had
other
results
as
well
gass
was
named
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
a
territorial
legislator
despite
his
ambition
gass
success
was
short
lived
in
the
late
1870s
he
defaulted
on
a
loan
from
rancher
archibald
stewart
so
stewart
took
the
las
vegas
ranch
for
his
own
true
to
wild
west
stereotypes
stewart
was
slain
by
a
neighboring
farmer
leaving
his
strong
willed
wife
helen
to
assume
the
duties
of
the
ranch
through
1905
helen
stewart
expanded
the
ranch
to
2000
acres
810
hectares
making
quite
a
bit
of
money
in
the
process
what
happened
next
would
mark
the
end
of
the
successful
las
vegas
ranch
and
the
beginning
of
the
era
of
the
subdivision
seen
across
almost
all
of
western
america
to
this
day
the
railroad
was
coming
and
when
it
arrived
las
vegas
would
never
be
the
same
again
of
tracks
and
tracts
at
the
turn
of
the
19th
century
los

and
salt
lake
city
were
among
the
burgeoning
metropolises
of
the
new
american
west
though
the
two
cities
remained
unlinked
by
rail
this
was
about
to
change
quickly
when
it
did
the
las
vegas
valley
which
at
the
time
had
a
non
native
population
of
less
than
30
would
change
as
well
in
1903
officials
of
the
san
pedro
los

and
salt

railroad
arrived
in
las
vegas
eager
to
secure
a
right
of
way
for
their
los

salt
lake
connection
las
vegas
would
serve
as
a
major
stopover
for
crew
rest
and
train
repair
for
all
this
the
railroad
needed
land
as
mapped
the
track
traveled
directly
through

stewart
sold
99
5
percent
of
her
ranch
to
the

the
remainder
she
returned
to
the
native
paiutes
in
early
1905
the
route
between
los

and

city
was
completed
and
train
tracks
bore
right
down
the
center
of
the
las

valley
on
15
may
1905
the
railroad
held
a
land
sale
a
momentous
step
in
las
vegas
history
standing
at
the
depot
at
main
and
fremont
streets
railroad
officials
auctioned
1200
lots
they
had
subdivided
from
forty
square
blocks
of
desert
scrub
land
speculators
and
locals
alike
were
anxious
to
own
a
part
of
the
newest
railroad
boomtown
and
within
an
afternoon
more
than
80
percent
of
the
lots
were
sold
las
vegas
was
no
longer
a
small
pioneer
settlement
with
rail
service
in
place
and
forty
blocks
of
private
property
it
was
ready
to
become
a
real
town
businesses
sprang
up
overnight
and
wooden
houses
were
erected
to
replace
the
tent
city
in
which
many
of
the
early
settlers
had
lived
one
year
after
the
auction
the
population
of
las
vegas
had
ballooned
to
1500
residents
a
portent
of
things
to
come
for
the
next
ninety
years
dam
good
luck
from
the
beginning
las
vegas
was
built
to
serve
travelers
the
railroad
needed
a
way
station
and
las
vegas
was
the
place
growth
continued
for
ten
years
and
by
1915
the
town
had
telephones
round
the
clock
electricity
and
a
growing
population
many
of
whom
worked
in
the
railroad
repair
shop
but
such
heady
progress
would
soon
come
to
a
halt
the
growing
competition
in
rail
transport
resulted
in
union
pacific
buying
the
los
angeles
salt
lake
line
union
pacific
then
consolidated
its
operations
eliminating
the
las
vegas
repair
facility
additionally
las
vegas
had
been
made
a
part
of
nevada
s
new
clark
county
in
1909
a
year
when
the
legislature
also
outlawed
gambling
these
unfortunate
circumstances
threatened
to
relegate
las
vegas
to
the
status
of
a
small
desert
community
that
could
no
longer
support
its
3000
residents
but
the
southwest
s
growing
need
for
water
combined
with
las
vegas
s
fortuitous
proximity
to
the
colorado
river
would
give
las
vegas
a
second
chance
to
achieve
prosperity
construction
on
hoover
dam
originally
boulder
dam
subsequently
renamed
for
the
president
who
authorized
the
project
began
in
1931
in
a
canyon
45
miles
72
km
southeast
of
las
vegas
providing
an
influx
of
165
million
to
the
southwestern
economy
hoover
dam
played
a
major
role
in
preventing
las
vegas
from
drying
up
both
financially
and
literally
not
only
did
it
create
jobs
but
it
also
created
lake
mead
the
massive
reservoir
that
today
provides
water
to
all
of
southern
nevada
more
government
help
the
construction
of
hoover
dam
did
not
single
handedly
save
las
vegas
however
the
state
legislature
helped
as
well
by
legalizing
gambling
in
1931
and
thus
solidifying
the
future
of
the
town
though
legislators
and
residents
could
never
have
known
this
at
the
time
the
hordes
of
people
who
attended
hoover
dam
s
1935
dedication
set
the
city
s
now
formidable
public
relations
machine
into
action
they
went
to
work
on
what
has
become
one
of
the
lengthiest
citywide
tourism
campaigns
ever
attempted
it
didn
t
take
long
for
the
city
to
establish
itself
as
a
wild
west
town
with
an
anything
goes
attitude
vices
outlawed
or
heavily
controlled
elsewhere
were
legal
here
available
any
hour
of
any
day
or
night
thus
originated
las

s
reputation
as
an
adult

for

would
launch
over
two

of
strong

in

freely

the

in

corporate
cash
though
las
vegas
had
developed
a
powerful
local
economy
few
major
outside
investments
were
made
in
the
city
due
primarily
to
mob
infiltration
and
its
inherent
ties
to
illegal
activities
that
would
change
dramatically
with
the
1966
arrival
of
billionaire
howard
hughes
a
legitimate
businessman
hughes
was
nonetheless
eccentric
and
dramatic
a
style
suited
to
the
las
vegas
ethos
true
to
the
myth
the
reclusive
hughes
immediately
cloistered
himself
in
the
desert
inn
s
penthouse
several
weeks
later
he
was
asked
then
ordered
to
vacate
the
room
to
make
room
for
high
rollers
whereupon
he
promptly
bought

and
fired

along
with

plots
of
land
stretching
from
the
strip
to
the
mountains
hughes
actions
would
have
beneficial
repercussions
both
immediate
and
lasting
because
of
the
new
legitimacy
las
vegas
acquired
from
hughes
investments
established
companies
such
as
hilton
hotels
bought
into
the
gaming
business
and
their
influence
helped
draw
a
line
in
the
desert
sand
between
legitimate
operations
and
mob
casinos
where
illegal
skimming
of
profits
was
rampant
that
combined
with
the
formation
of
the

control
board
would
signal
the
beginning
of
the
end
for
heavy
mob
influence
in
the
city
las

with
a
vision
as
corporations
moved
in
and
the

was
slowly
pushed
out
a
new
las

emerged
the
legitimization
of

led
to
its
increased
legalization
across
the
us
what
was
once
a
sure
thing
became
much
more
competitive
casino
operators
had
to
reassess
the
nature
of

the
first
to
really
do
so
was
steve
wynn
a
las

resident
and
owner
of
the
golden

in
the
mid
1980s
wynn
began
plans
to
reinvigorate

with

he
bought
several

properties
the

and
castaways
among
them
and
demolished

wynn

the

showed
signs
of
backlash
with
many

criticizing
the

the

perhaps
the
best
of

the

by

that
built

the

will

dublin
and
the
dubliners
as
capital
of
europe
s
most
explosive
economy
dublin
seems
to
be
changing
before
your
very
eyes
new
construction
is
everywhere
the
streets
buzz
traffic
is
increasingly
congested
and
in
the
frenetic
pace
of
rush
hour
everyone
in
dublin
seems
intent
on
changing
places
with
everyone
else
at
night
the
streets
are
crowded
with
people
bent
on
having
a
good
time
prosperity
is
in
the
air
the
roar
of
the
celtic
tiger
can
clearly
be
heard
but
this
is
not
the
whole
picture
the
proverbial
hospitality
and
warm
welcome
are
still
here
this
busy
modern
european
city
sits
on
a
thousand
years
of
history
history
is
present
everywhere
from
elegant
merrion
square
to
the
bullet
holes
on
the
general
post
office
it
s
also
a
city
of
the
imagination
reinvented
and
reappraised
in
the
literature
of
its
exiles
and
the
old
dublin
is
with
us
too
the
irreverent
city
of
wit
and
charm
and
that
peculiar
magic
possessed
by
ireland
and
the
irish
prosperity
has
brought
with
it
a
new
emphasis
on
historic
preservation
dublin
excels
in
packaging
its
past
for
the
visitor
you
can
view
artifacts
from
the
bronze
age
trace
the
history
of
the
easter
rising
or
revisit
leopold
bloom
s
odyssey
in
ulysses
old
buildings
are
being
recycled
for
example
the
17th
century
royal
hospital
now
holds
the
museum
of
modern
art
and
dublin
a
city
large
in
expectations
is
still
small
enough
for
the
visitor
to
see
most
of
its
sights

the
river
liffey
flows

the
river
forms
a
natural
line
between
the
north
and
south
sections
of
the
city
this
geography
is
important
in
understanding
dublin
historically
and
culturally
this
north
south
distinction
has
always
been
significant
and
it
still
is
today
with
a
dose
of
good
humored
rivalry
between
the
two
areas
i
never
go
north
of
the
liffey
one
man
remarked
farther
out
both
north
and
south
are
the
sweeping
curves
of
the
royal
and
grand
canals
the
occasional
cry
of
gulls
and
unexpected
distant
vistas
will
remind
you
that
dublin
is
by
the
sea
and
the
wicklow
mountains
which
hold
dublin
closely
to
the
coast
are
visible
from
everywhere
dublin
is
an
intimate
city
physically
small
but
tightly
packed
a
perfect
place

on
you
in

all
the

the
climate
here
can
best
be
described
as
changeable
and
yet
the
sudden
shifts
from
light
to
dark
sunshine
to
shower
are
part
of
the
city
s
magic
buildings
seem
to
transform
themselves
depending
on
the

dublin
under
a
lowering

is
a
different
place
from
dublin

enjoying
dublin
literature
has
always
flourished
in
dublin
the
only
city
to
have
produced
three
nobel

winners
for

and
beckett
joyce
the
high
priest
of
literary
modernism
imagined
and
interpreted
dublin
for
the
world
in
ulysses
you
ll
see
references
to
it
all
over
however
sometimes
it
seems
that
the
city
produced
artists
of
this
stature
by
accident
even
against
its
will
beckett
and
joyce
among
others
had
to
leave
their
homeland
to
understand
it
and
to
be
understood
dublin
theater
is
legendary
and
no
visitor
should
miss
seeing
a
performance
at
the
abbey
theatre
or

theatre
the
city
s
impact
on
the
rock
and
pop
music
scene
with
the
likes
of
u2
and
bob
geldof
is
well
known
there
s
even
a
self
guided
tour
of
their
haunts
traditional
irish
music
is
also
alive
and
well
especially
in
the
pubs
and
there
has
been
a
revival
of
storytelling
poetry
reading
and
traditional
dancing
and
in
this
city
where
literature
and
theater
have
historically
dominated
the
scene
visual
arts
are
finally
coming
into
their
own
with
the
new
museum
of
modern
art
and
the
many
galleries
that
display
the
work
of
modern
irish
artists
the
constantly
crowded
and
busy
grafton
street
is
the
most
visible
center
for
shopping
but
there
are
shops
all
over
that
carry
an
international
array
of
goods
as
well
as
the
irish
crafts
and
souvenirs
you
expect
and
while
multinational
chains
have
made
inroads
they
seem
less
blatant
here
than
elsewhere
many
shops
and
also
hotels
and
guest
houses
have
been
owned
and
managed
by
the
same
families
for
years
and
theirs
is
the
welcome
of
traditional
dublin
hospitality
dublin
s
food
has
undergone
a
metamorphosis
there
was
a
time
when
you
might
have
apologized
for
it
but
no
longer
dublin
has
international
restaurants
galore
and
the
new
irish
cuisine
is
built
upon
fresh
products
of
ireland
s
seas
rivers
and
farms
coffee
has
replaced
the
ubiquitous
tea
dublin
is
now
almost
as
much
a
coffee
city
as
vienna
or
seattle
city
and
countryside
in
a
city
of
such
human
proportions
it
is
not
surprising
that
parks
and
gardens
abound
for
recreation
and
relaxation
phoenix
park
in
the
northwest
is
the
largest
open
space
but
squares
like
st
stephen
s
green
are
the
garden
oases
of
the
city
on
the

sandymount
dollymount
and

are
the
places
to
go
the

the

has
breathtaking

young
at
heart
dublin
is
a
young
city
almost
half
of
ireland
s
population
is
under
twenty
five
and
with
its
universities
and
professional
schools
dublin
also
has
a
large
student
population
the
universities
attract
students
from
all
over
the
world
and
this
influx
helps
to
make
dublin
a
busy
buzzing
international
city
however
young

old
stranger
and

rub
shoulders
quite
happily
religion

exciting

these
words
have
described
hong

for
at

a
century
with
its
vibrant
atmosphere
and
night
and
day
activity
it
is
an
intoxicating
place
hong
kong
is
crowded
it
has
one
of
the
world
s
greatest
population
densities
but
it
is
also
efficient
with
one
of
the
best
transportation
systems
anywhere
and
for
such
a
crowded
place
quiet
you
don
t
hear
voices
raised
in
anger
motorists
sitting
on
their
horns
or
loud
boomboxes
shopping
never
ends
there
s
always
another
inviting
spot
just
down

find

easy
to
get
around

up
to
its
reputation
on
1
july
1997
the
british
crown
colony
of
hong
kong
reverted
to
chinese
sovereignty
as
a
special
administrative
region
of
the
people
s
republic
of
china
today
hong
kong
remains
a
capitalist
enclave
with
its
laws
and
rights
intact
and
china
has
promised
that
hong
kong
will
continue
in
this
fashion
for
at
least
50
years
beijing
s
announced
policy
of
maintaining
hong
kong
s
prosperity
and
stability
makes
sense
hong
kong
has
long
been
china
s
handiest
window
on
the
west
and
the
city
is
unrivaled
in
its
commercial
know
how
and
managerial
expertise
around
the
time
of
the
transition
there
was
much
speculation
about
how
things
would
change
but
in
fact
once
news
of
the
handover
vanished
from
the
front
pages
the
people
of
hong
kong
returned
to
their
usual
topics
of
conversation
the
economy
and
the
price
of
housing
the
impression
of
the
visitor
today
will
be
that
very
little
has
changed
establishments
are
no
longer
called
royal
queen
elizabeth
has
vanished
from
the
coinage
and
the
union
jack
has
been
replaced
by
the
flag
of
china
and
the
new
hong
kong
flag
with
its
bauhinia
flower
but
in
fact
there
have
been
changes
many
of
them
due
to
economic
progress
new
construction
and
other
factors
that
influence
cities
all
over
the
world
others
are
more
subtle
british
social
customs
are
still
evident
in
the
kind
of
polite
service
you
get
in
hotels
and
in
the
long
lines
of
people
waiting
for

at
rush

the
british

has
decreased

criticized

the

there

the
chinese
people
have
been
described
as
hardworking
and
pragmatic
attitudes
that
have
contributed
to
hong

success

it
s
anyone

guess
what
may
happen
in

for
now
hong

bristles
with
energy

and
for
the

this

is
an

the

you
avoid
the

note
that

you

find

with
something
of

portuguese
inheritance
as
well

the
chinese
a
fusion
of
east
and
west
that
has
produced
the
unique
macanese
culture
the
story
of
the
western
discovery
of
macau
begins
in
1513
when
portuguese
explorer
jorge
alvares
reached
the
south
coast
of
china
traders
followed
in
his
wake
setting
up
bases
in
several
parts
of
the
pearl
river
estuary
finally
in
1557
they
were
all
consolidated
in
macau
it
was
the
only
european
gateway
to
china
and
through
macau
flowed
western
technology
and
religion
in
1576
pope
gregory
xiii
created
the
macau
diocese
covering
all
of
china
and
japan
no
less
impressive
were
the
secular
challenges
china
and
japan
were
not
on
speaking
terms
so
trade
between
them
had
to
be
channeled
through
a
neutral
middleman
lucky
macau
fit
the
specifications
exactly
portugal
s
resulting
near
monopoly
of
east
west
trade
understandably
awakened
the
competitive
instincts
of
other
european
powers
the
dutch
sent
an
invasion
flotilla
to
macau
in
1622
but
the
defenders
triumphed
however
the
end
of
the
golden
age
was
drawing
near
china
began
to
relax
trade
restrictions
and
with
the
rise
of
hong
kong
macau
became
an
isolated
portuguese
outpost
a
haven
for
persecuted
japanese
christians
in
the
17th
century
portugal
s
neutrality
during
world
war
ii
assured
the
territory
a
flood
of
refugees
they
were
joined
by
a
swarm
of
spies
of
all
conceivable
nationalities
and
macau
won
a
name
for
international
intrigue
portugal
s
very
precarious
foothold
on
the
asian
coast
ended
in
1999
with
a
formal
handover
to
china
macau
now
