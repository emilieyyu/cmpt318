### Data Analysis
Analyze by extracting useful information using:

###### time machine

###### travel
Script Execution *travelscript.sh*:  
1. ```chmod +x travelscript.sh```  
2. ```./travelscript.sh```  
What the script does:  
The script removes all extra tabs in front of each line. It then tokenizes the textfile and sorts based on alphabetical order, frequency, and also creates corresponding 2, 3, 4 gram files. *ngram_files* contains all temporary files created during the process for reference.

###### xab

###### 4th file
