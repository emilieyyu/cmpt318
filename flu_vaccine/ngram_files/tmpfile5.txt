vaccines
are
one
of
the
great
success
stories
of
modern
medicine
because
of
them
we
are
no
longer
vulnerable
to
smallpox
or
polio
or
measles
the
flu
vaccine
however
is
a
different
story
its
effectiveness
varies
from
patient
to
patient
from
population
to
population
and
from
year
to
year
it
needs
to
be
updated
each
season
and
even
in
a
good
year
is
usually
no
more
than
50
effective
we
may
rely
on
it
to
avoid
catching
the
flu
but
its
story
demonstrates
how
far
we
still
are
from
a
reliable
vaccine

vaccination
the
process
of
infecting
a
healthy
person
with
a
microbe
to
prevent
disease
dates
back
at
least
a
thousand
years
but
the
start
of
vaccination
as
we
think
of
it
today
is
generally
credited
to
the
work
of
edward
jenner
a
british
physician
born
in
1749
jenner
was
a
keen
observer
with
a
deep
interest
in
the
natural
world
and
found
time
for
both
serious
study
and
artistic
play
he
investigated
everything
from
hydrogen
balloons
to
the
life
cycle
of
the
cuckoo
wrote
poetry
and
played
the
violin
but
smallpox
or
rather
the
eradication
of
it
is
his
legacy
because
of
jenner
this
virus
is
not
on
our
list
of
worries
today
smallpox
was
a
vicious
disease
that
killed
more
than
30
of
those
who
contracted
it
in
the
1700s
there
was
one
demographic
however
that
seemed
to
be
immune
milkmaids
it
had
been
observed
that
in
the
course
of
their
job
milking
cows
women
came
into
contact
with
the
milder
bovine
version
of
the
smallpox
virus
called
cowpox
these
women
then
became
immune
to
the
deadlier
human
smallpox
virus
there
was
something
in
the
cowpox
that
protected
against
smallpox
and
in
1796
edward
jenner
famously
took
material
from
the
fresh
pustules
on
a
milkmaid
s
hand
and
inserted
it
under
the
skin
of
a
young
boy
named
james
phipps
after
a
brief
and
mild
illness
phipps
recovered
completely
jenner
then
infected
him
with
scrapings
from
a
smallpox
lesion
again
and
again
but
the
boy
never
got
sick
jenner
named
this
process
vaccination
after
variolae
vaccinae
a
latin
term
for
cowpox
his
technique
quickly
spread
through
19th
century
england
and
beyond
saving
countless
people
inspiring
modifications
to
the
technique
and
changing
the
course
of
history
jenner
s
smallpox
vaccine
was
improved
and
modified
over
the
next
several
decades
and
was
soon
joined
by
others
louis
pasteur
developed
vaccines
for
animal
diseases
such
as
chicken
cholera
and
anthrax
but
of
these
he
is
best
remembered
for
his
rabies
vaccine
rabies
was
a
common
and
uniformly
fatal
disease
in
the
19th
century
once
a
victim
is
bitten
by
a
rabid
animal
the
virus
multiplies
slowly
and
infects
the
brain
and
nervous
system
pasteur
did
not
know
of
the
viral
cause
but
this
didn
t
really
matter
he
dissected
and
dried
out
the
spinal
cords
of
infected
animals
and
then
injected
the
remains
into
test
animals
which
then
showed
immunity
to
rabies
what
pasteur
was
doing
was
in
fact
weakening
the
virus
making
it
a
goldilocks
version
it
was
not
strong
enough
to
kill
and
it
was
not
weak
enough
to
be
ignored
by
our
immune
system
one
hundred
years
ago
during
the
1918
flu
pandemic
there
were
no
flu
vaccines
we
didn
t
know
precisely
what
was
causing
the
disease
so
we
couldn
t
manufacture
a
vaccine
to
protect
us
but
this
didn
t
stop
scientists
and
doctors
from
doing
something
anything
to
combat
the
outbreak
in
1919
edward
rosenow
from
the
mayo
clinic
in
rochester
minnesota
isolated
several
bacteria
from
the
sputum
and
lungs
of
flu
patients
in
rochester
formulated
a
vaccine
that
contained
five
different
kinds
of
bacteria
and
doled
it
out
to
100
000
people
at
tufts
college
medical
school
in
boston
timothy
leary
whose
nephew
and
namesake
would
also
become
a
doctor
and
experiment
with
psychedelics
produced
his
own
blended
vaccine
using
strains
from
the
chelsea
naval
hospital
a
nurse
s
nose
at
carney
hospital
and
the
infected
wards
of
camp
devens
leary
mixed
these
samples
together
grew
them
on
plates
of
agar
and
then
sterilised
the
mixture
his
vaccine
was
sent
to
san
francisco
where
at
least
18
000
people
were
inoculated
with
it
these
and
other
efforts
gave
hope
to
a
ravaged
nation
one
health
official
at
the
time
wrote
that
the
greatest
value
of
a
flu
vaccine
was
that
it
reduced
fluphobia
worry
and
fear
were
as
quick
to
spread
as
the
disease
itself
and
any
vaccine
that
provided
at
least
mental
relief
was
welcome
there
was
no
evidence
of
course
that
any
of
these
vaccines
actually
worked
today
physicians
go
to
great
lengths
to
be
sure
that
vaccine
trials
adhere
to
stringent
standards
but
a
century
ago
these
did
not
exist
many
of
the
vaccine
trials
were
conducted
on
survivors
of
the
flu
after
the
initial
epidemic
had
passed
meaning
that
the
pool
was
tainted
with
a
degree
of
immunity
in
1933
the
flu
virus
was
identified
and
scientists
could
then
confront
the
culprit
rather
than
the
mess
in
its
wake
russians
led
the
field
weakening
the
virus
by
transplanting
it
between
chicken
eggs
around
one
billion
people
in
the
ussr
were
vaccinated
using
the
live
but
weakened
flu
virus
and
it
was
still
in
use
at
the
end
of
the
20th
century
although
it
appeared
to
be
successful
the
live
flu
vaccine
was
never
tested
in
a
rigorous
way
and
it
remained
a
constant
danger
since
it
used
a
live
virus
it
could
cross
with
other
strains
and
morph
into
a
more
virulent
version
vaccine
researchers
therefore
turned
their
attention
to
creating
a
vaccine
containing
what
they
called
inactive
strains
the
virus
was
still
grown
in
chick
embryos
but
this
time
it
was
rendered
inactive
by
dunking
it
in
a
bath
of
formalin
disinfectant
although
a
higher
dose
of
the
inactive
vaccine
was
needed
to
produce
an
immune
response
there
was
no
concern
about
the
virus
replicating
for
the
first
several
years
the
influenza
vaccine
contained
only
one
strain
the
influenza
a
virus
because
as
far
as
anyone
knew
that
was
the
only
kind
of
influenza
out
there
in
1940
influenza
b
was
identified
which
kicked
off
the
perpetual
task
of
calibrating
vaccines
to
deal
with
multiple
evolving
strains
by
the
1950s
we
had
a
vaccine
that
was
effective
against
both
a
and
b
but
the
virus
as
always
was
outpacing
us
by
the
late
1970s
we
had
to
make
a
vaccine
to
hit
three
strains
for
the
2016
7
flu
season
most
of
the
vaccine
doses
manufactured
in
the
us
targeted
four
different
strains
the
past
100
years
have
been
a
ceaseless
arms
race
against
an
enemy
with
whom
we
cannot
negotiate
the
key
to
a
good
flu
vaccine
is
matching
it
to
the
strains
that
are
in
circulation
during
a
given
season
the
challenge
is
that
it
takes
about
six
months
to
produce
the
vaccine
and
so
the
manufacturers
have
to
base
their
ingredients
on
some
clever
detective
work
led
by
the
world
health
organization
there
are
about
110
who
flu
centres
in
80
countries
that
receive
swabs
from
the
noses
and
throats
of
patients
with
influenza
like
illnesses
these
centres
identify
the
flu
strains
that
are
circulating
and
occasionally
they
will
find
a
new
one
when
this
happens
they
send
it
to
one
of
five
collaborating
centres
in
london
atlanta
melbourne
tokyo
and
beijing
for
a
more
detailed
molecular
analysis
twice
a
year
in
february
for
the
northern
hemisphere
and
september
for
the
southern
the
who
convenes
a
meeting
to
collate
all
the
information
and
recommend
a
vaccine
recipe
for
the
upcoming
season
in
the
us
the
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
cdc
in
atlanta
provide
additional
domestic
data
and
the
food
and
drug
administration
makes
a
final
decision
on
what
goes
into
the
vaccine
the
manufacturers
then
have
about
six
months
to
get
the
recommended
flu
vaccine
to
market
a
flu
vaccination
the
us
recommends
universal
flu
vaccination
but
the
uk
does
not
photograph
david
cheskin
pa
because
the
influenza
virus
can
mutate
so
quickly
nailing
the
exact
recipe
is
challenging
in
some
seasons
the
match
is
close
to
perfect
but
this
is
not
always
the
case
if
the
virus
drifts
after
the
february
meeting
of
the
who
there
will
be
a
mismatch
between
vaccine
and
virus
the
greater
the
mismatch
the
less
effective
the
vaccine
in
a
good
year
we
might
expect
the
vaccine
to
be
50
60
effective
in
the
2004
5
flu
season
that
figure
was
only
10
meaning
that
the
vaccine
was
a
big
misfire
we
also
botched
the
2014
5
season
when
new
strains
hadn
t
been
included
in
the
vaccine
that
season
the
vaccine
was
a
measly
19
effective
compared
to
over
50
in
the
previous
year
early
on
in
the
2017
8
influenza
season
there
were
near
record
numbers
of
hospitalisations
and
though
the
latest
vaccine
s
performance
improved
throughout
the
season
overall
effectiveness
is
estimated
to
have
been
40
even
if
the
vaccine
hits
the
bullseye
different
demographics
have
different
reactions
to
it
children
have
a
very
good
response
to
the
vaccine
the
situation
is
more
complicated
with
elderly
patients
who
have
weaker
immune
systems
overall
but
also
have
a
lifetime
buildup
of
natural
immunity
after
withstanding
many
flu
seasons
their
immune
systems
are
wiser
you
might
say
than
those
of
the
young
the
us
and
most
other
developed
countries
strongly
recommend
that
older
people
receive
a
flu
vaccine
one
study
compared
18
different
groups
over
10
influenza
seasons
and
found
that
the
vaccine
reduced
the
overall
winter
mortality
rate
in
older
people
by
an
astonishing
50
but
cdc
epidemiologists
have
shown
that
the
influenza
mortality
rate
among
older
people
rose
alongside
the
vaccination
rate
which
raises
questions
about
the
urgency
to
vaccinate
them
the
bottom
line
is
this
even
if
elderly
people
are
vaccinated
they
are
still
the
population
most
likely
to
die
from
influenza
one
way
to
better
protect
older
people
is
to
vaccinate
an
entirely
different
demographic
schoolchildren
this
notion
was
elegantly
demonstrated
in
a
natural
experiment
in
japan
from
1962
to
1987
most
japanese
schoolchildren
were
vaccinated
against
influenza
at
one
point
the
vaccine
was
mandatory
for
a
solid
decade
the
vaccination
rate
grew
to
around
85
but
the
mandatory
vaccination
programme
was
discontinued
in
1994
over
the
next
several
years
there
was
an
increase
in
the
number
of
deaths
in
elderly
people
during
the
flu
seasons
in
the
us
where
there
had
been
no
change
in
the
vaccination
policy
deaths
of
elderly
people
over
the
same
flu
seasons
remained
unchanged
vaccinating
one
part
of
the
population
in
other
words
benefits
another
data
can
be
interpreted
in
many
ways
and
each
nation
has
crafted
its
own
policy
accordingly
the
cdc
has
recommended
the
flu
vaccine
for
all
healthy
children
in
the
us
since
2008
in
2013
the
uk
phased
in
a
child
flu
vaccination
policy
in
contrast
to
the
majority
of
european
countries
germany
provides
free
vaccines
only
to
older
people
leaving
parents
to
pay
for
their
children
across
europe
the
childhood
vaccination
rate
is
15
compared
to
almost
60
in
the
us
if
flu
vaccines
are
indeed
mankind
s
greatest
weapon
against
the
flu
why
are
they
used
in
wildly
different
capacities
when
my
colleagues
gave
one
another
the
influenza
vaccine
at
the
george
washington
university
hospital
we
were
following
the
advice
of
the
cdc
when
patients
with
influenza
started
to
roll
into
the
emergency
room
a
few
months
later
i
would
ask
if
they
had
received
a
flu
shot
many
had
and
yet
here
they
were
in
the
hospital
i
knew
how
they
felt
my
only
visit
to
the
emergency
department
as
a
patient
the
year
i
got
a
nasty
case
of
the
flu
was
after
i
had
been
given
the
flu
vaccine
despite
the
regular
failure
of
the
vaccine
americans
are
bombarded
every
year
with
reminders
and
opportunities
to
get
a
flu
shot
by
the
end
of
august
pharmacies
are
posting
signs
and
doctors
offices
are
gearing
up
the
vaccine
is
offered
at
many
workplaces
and
houses
of
worship
and
hospitals
require
all
their
health
care
providers
to
be
vaccinated
behind
this
effort
is
the
cdc
which
recommends
the
flu
vaccine
for
everyone
over
the
age
of
six
months
one
cdc
poster
that
caught
my
attention
asked
who
needs
a
flu
vaccine
a
you
b
you
c
you
d
all
of
the
above
in
case
you
were
wondering
the
correct
answer
is
d
the
poster
reminded
us
that
even
healthy
people
can
get
the
flu
and
it
can
be
serious
the
message
then
got
more
explicit
everyone
6
months
and
older
should
get
a
flu
vaccine
this
means
you
recommendations
about
the
use
of
vaccines
in
the
us
are
made
by
the
advisory
committee
on
immunization
practices
acip
a
group
of
more
than
a
dozen
experts
with
backgrounds
in
vaccination
research
public
health
and
health
policy
it
meets
three
times
a
year
to
review
any
new
evidence
and
provide
advice
and
guidance
to
the
director
of
the
cdc
about
the
use
of
vaccines
as
recently
as
2006
the
committee
recommended
the
flu
vaccine
only
for
those
at
high
risk
for
complications
of
influenza
and
adults
over
the
age
of
50
but
a
couple
of
years
later
it
expanded
its
recommendations
to
include
everyone
over
the
age
of
six
months
and
that
recommendation
has
remained
in
place
ever
since
the
public
health
campaign
by
the
cdc
to
vaccinate
everyone
is
not
shared
by
other
countries
europe
and
australia
recommend
the
vaccine
only
for
the
very
young
the
elderly
and
those
with
underlying
illnesses
healthy
adults
are
simply
not
targeted
it
s
very
difficult
to
compare
death
rates
from
influenza
across
different
countries
because
the
definition
of
an
influenza
case
varies
as
does
the
way
in
wahich
a
country
collects
its
own
statistics
often
deaths
from
viral
influenza
and
bacterial
pneumonia
are
listed
together
it
is
challenging
therefore
to
compare
the
data
we
have
from
the
us
and
the
uk
however
in
the
uk
the
death
rate
from
influenza
in
2014
was
0
2
per
100
000
people
and
in
the
us
it
was
1
4
per
100
000
that
is
seven
times
higher
than
in
the
uk
a
country
that
vaccinates
far
less
of
its
population
these
numbers
must
be
interpreted
with
caution
but
they
do
at
least
suggest
that
the
approach
in
the
uk
is
reasonable
how
can
we
properly
determine
whether
a
vaccination
for
all
programme
such
as
the
one
in
the
us
saves
more
lives
and
protects
more
people
than
the
english
vaccination
for
some
perhaps
for
one
flu
season
we
could
encourage
everyone
to
get
vaccinated
and
for
the
next
we
would
encourage
only
those
at
increased
risk
we
could
compare
the
influenza
death
rates
between
the
two
groups
and
get
our
answer
of
course
it
s
more
complicated
than
that
because
the
mortality
rate
from
influenza
is
so
low
we
would
need
to
enroll
hundreds
of
thousands
of
patients
in
order
to
see
if
the
vaccine
made
a
difference
however
an
experiment
like
this
might
be
undermined
by
the
strains
of
influenza
that
were
circulating
in
each
year
if
one
year
s
strain
was
more
contagious
or
deadlier
than
the
next
our
experiment
would
tell
us
nothing

trends
this
method
was
used
by
the
cochrane
collaboration
an
international
group
of
37
000
medical
contributors
in
2014
when
they
reviewed
all
the
studies
that
evaluated
the
effects
of
the
flu
vaccine
in
healthy
us
adults
it
was
a
large
undertaking
there
were
90
studies
that
compared
giving
the
vaccine
to
withholding
it
and
a
total
of
8
million
patients
were
involved
the
cochrane
review
found
that
the
effect
of
the
flu
vaccine
in
healthy
adults
was
small
about
2
5
of
those
not
vaccinated
became
ill
versus
1
1
of
those
who
were
that
s
very
small
put
another
way
you
would
need
to
vaccinate
71
people
to
prevent
one
case
of
actual
influenza
the
vaccine
did
not
reduce
the
number
of
working
days
lost
or
the
number
of
hospitalisations
so
yes
the
vaccine
does
prevent
influenza
in
young
healthy
adults
but
in
a
very
modest
way
so
why
does
the
us
still
recommend
universal
vaccination
while
the
uk
does
not
it
comes
down
to
language
the
cdc
describes
the
flu
like
this
in
a
poster
intended
for
use
in
doctors
offices
the
flu
may
make
people
cough
and
have
a
sore
throat
and
fever
they
may
also
have
a
runny
or
stuffy
nose
feel
tired
have
body
aches
or
show
other
signs
they
are
not
well
the
flu
happens
every
year
and
is
more
common
in
the
fall
and
winter
in
the
us
people
of
all
ages
can
get
the
flu
from
babies
and
young
adults
to
the
elderly
not
so
bad
but
then
this
is
on
the
homepage
of
the
cdc
s
flu
site
it
can
cause
mild
to
severe
illness
serious
outcomes
of
flu
infection
can
result
in
hospitalization
or
death
some
people
such
as
older
people
young
children
and
people
with
certain
health
conditions
are
at
high
risk
of
serious
flu
complications
the
best
way
to
prevent
the
flu
is
by
getting
vaccinated
each
year
the
cdc
s
approach
to
flu
is
that
it
is
a
potentially
deadly
disease
that
can
be
prevented
with
a
vaccine
the
british
take
another
approach
here
is
the
advice
about
the
flu
from
the
nhs
flu
is
a
common
infectious
viral
illness
spread
by
coughs
and
sneezes
it
can
be
very
unpleasant
but
you
ll
usually
begin
to
feel
better
within
about
a
week
[if
you
are
an
otherwise
healthy
adult]
there
s
usually
no
need
to
see
a
doctor
if
you
have
flu
like
symptoms
the
best
remedy
is
to
rest
at
home
keep
warm
and
drink
plenty
of
water
to
avoid
dehydration
at
most
according
to
the
british
influenza
can
be
a
bit
of
a
nuisance
most
people
will
make
a
full
recovery
and
won
t
experience
any
further
problems
but
elderly
people
and
people
with
certain
long
term
medical
conditions
are
more
likely
to
have
a
bad
case
of
flu
or
develop
a
serious
complication
such
as
a
chest
infection
there
s
no
mention
of
death
as
a
complication
it
s
all
very
keep
calm
and
carry
on
just
like
it
was
during
the
1918
pandemic
is
the
flu
a
killer
or
an
irritant
we
know
with
certainty
that
each
year
it
kills
many
people
in
both
the
us
and
britain
and
we
know
with
equal
certainty
that
for
almost
all
healthy
people
the
flu
is
nothing
but
a
minor
annoyance
both
are
correct
that
s
the
nature
of
influenza
it
s
tricky
and
mysterious
causing
discomfort
in
some
of
its
victims
and
death
in
others
it
s
just
that
the
us
and
the
uk
quantify
them
in
different
ways
the
british
version
of
the
cdc
s
vaccine
advisory
committee
is
called
the
joint
committee
on
vaccination
and
immunisation
jcvi
it
meets
three
times
a
year
reviews
the
scientific
evidence
and
makes
recommen
dations
to
the
secretary
of
state
for
health
if
there
is
a
need
to
change
the
vaccination
policy
andrew
pollard
the
head
of
the
jcvi
trained
as
a
paediatrician
and
is
now
professor
of
paediatric
infection
and
immunity
at
the
university
of
oxford
pollard
is
extremely
cognisant
of
the
numerous
effects
of
the
flu
but
for
the
jcvi
the
biggest
measure
is
cost
effectiveness
it
may
seem
cold
or
callous
to
fixate
on
costs
when
lives
are
at
stake
but
money
and
resources
are
limited
and
reckless
or
misdirected
spending
can
lead
to
poor
medical
practices
or
greater
harm
for
example
spending
1m
on
medications
for
those
who
have
had
a
heart
attack
might
save
1
000
lives
each
year
that
same
1m
might
have
been
spent
instead
on
screenings
for
cervical
cancer
which
would
save
the
lives
of
60
000
women
each
year
what
s
more
important
saving
1
000
lives
or
60
000
lives
it
often
comes
down
to
who
is
asking
and
which
disease
it
is
that
you
have
andrew
pollard
and
his
team
at
the
jcvi
looked
at
studies
that
measured
the
cost
effectiveness
of
the
influenza
vaccine
they
concluded
that
given
the
vanishingly
small
number
of
young
healthy
adults
who
become
severely
ill
or
die
from
the
flu
it
is
not
cost
effective
to
vaccinate
this
section
of
the
population
pollard
s
committee
measures
the
cost
to
the
health
system
itself
how
much
the
vaccine
costs
and
how
much
it
decreases
the
number
of
days
that
patients
spend
in
hospital
or
in
intensive
care
they
also
estimate
the
vaccine
s
effect
on
the
number
of
flu
related
visits
to
doctors
offices
what
they
don
t
measure
is
the
wider
cost
to
society
which
includes
lost
labour
lost
wages
or
the
time
a
parent
must
spend
taking
care
of
a
child
these
too
are
burdens
on
society
but
they
do
not
enter
into
the
deliberations
of
the
jcvi
the
vaccine
is
cost
effective
to
the
healthcare
system
when
it
is
given
to
children
older
people
those
with
medical
conditions
and
pregnant
women
it
is
not
cost
effective
when
given
to
young
healthy
adults
in
the
us
the
cost
effectiveness
of
the
vaccine
is
less
important
what
is
more
important
is
whether
or
not
it
works
this
approach
has
resulted
in
another
difference
in
vaccination
policy
between
the
us
and
the
uk
this
time
over
the
vaccine
for
chickenpox
the
varicella
vaccine
can
prevent
both
chickenpox
and
shingles
a
later
complication
of
the
disease
in
the
us
the
varicella
vaccine
is
recommended
for
all
children
the
first
dose
is
given
at
12
months
of
age
and
a
booster
shot
four
years
later
in
the
uk
varicella
is
not
on
the
list
of
vaccines
for
children
in
the
us
if
a
vaccine
has
been
shown
to
work
safely
the
cdc
generally
recommends
it
at
the
beginning
of
the
1976
flu
outbreak
president
gerald
ford
had
to
choose
between
two
perfectly
sound
recommendations
one
was
to
quickly
vaccinate
as
many
people
as
possible
while
the
other
was
to
stockpile
the
vaccine
and
wait
to
see
whether
things
got
worse
ford
rejected
the
wait
and
see
approach
we
cannot
afford
to
take
a
chance
with
the
health
of
our
nation
he
said
better
to
err
on
the
side
of
overreaction
than
underreaction
this
is
the
overriding
approach
to
healthcare
in
the
us
they
are
always
ready
to
do
more
to
try
the
latest
medications
or
surgical
procedures
because
well
why
take
a
chance
compared
with
other
western
countries
the
us
does
more
invasive
studies
of
the
heart
for
patients
with
chest
pain
without
actually
improving
their
outcomes
we
in
the
us
put
more
of
our
patients
into
the
intensive
care
unit
even
though
they
are
on
average
less
sick
than
their
counterparts
abroad
we
give
more
chemotherapy
to
cancer
patients
near
the
ends
of
their
disease
even
though
it
improves
neither
the
quality
nor
the
length
of
their
lives
we
do
these
things
because
we
can
because
to
do
otherwise
would
be
considered
giving
up
even
if
doing
less
would
be
an
extremely
sensible
and
kind
decision
influenza
is
not
cancer
and
it
is
not
heart
disease
but
the
us
approach
to
it
is
emblematic
of
the
way
it
treats
most
diseases
doing
more
is
better
if
there
is
an
unexhausted
option
exhaust
it
and
because
many
vaccines
have
had
spectacular
success
in
preventing
and
eradicating
some
ghastly
infectious
diseases
the
expectation
is
that
the
influenza
vaccine
will
do
the
same
it
s
another
hi
tech
solution
to
most
people
the
word
vaccine
is
tantamount
to
a
guarantee
that
a
disease
will
leave
you
alone
why
can
t
we
cure
the
common
cold
read
more
it
s
hard
to
make
a
catchy
public
service
announcement
that
reflects
the
subtleties
therein
vaccinate
everyone
over
six
months
old
is
the
current
message
it
is
easy
to
understand
and
easy
to
remember
a
more
accurate
message
is
much
clumsier
vaccinate
school
aged
children
and
pregnant
women
and
probably
elderly
people
but
the
evidence
is
mixed
and
those
with
chronic
conditions
but
no
need
to
vaccinate
young
healthy
adults
that
wouldn
t
really
fit
on
a
billboard
in
this
case
nuance
may
invite
danger
the
quest
for
a
better
influenza
vaccine
continues
the
holy
grail
would
be
a
vaccine
that
covers
all
possible
strains
of
influenza
so
there
would
be
no
problem
of
mismatched
vaccination
and
that

to
be
given
only
once

year

of
